However, Nicki insisted to her stans, the <strong>Barbz</strong>, that the longer the wait, the sweeter the reward.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/nicki-minaj-album-spl-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-3>“Dear Barbz, I’ve been trying to find the right time to tell you this for a few days,” the Trinidad and Tobago native <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>wrote</a> alongside a stunning photo of herself with pink locks. “Due to some really exciting news that I’ll share with you guys @ a later time, I’ve shifted the album date just a tad bit. Trust me, it’ll be WELL WORTH THE WAIT…”</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>The announcement comes after Nicki has been enjoying one heck of a renaissance. The rap goddess made history in 2020, snagging her very first no. 1 single — the remix of<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong> Doja Cat’s</strong> “Say So.”</a> Then two years later, she debuted the Rick James–sampling single “Super Freaky Girl,” which made her the first solo female rapper to debut atop the Billboard singles chart since <strong>Lauryn Hill</strong>, per <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Pitchfork</a>. She also won the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>MTV VMAs’ Video Vanguard Award&nbsp;</a>in 2022!</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>With the recent accolades, it appears Nicki has set the stage for her next magic trick. And it’s a new album! Let’s learn more about it, below.</p><h2><strong>What Is Nicki Minaj’s New Album Called?&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h2><p id=content-paragraph-8>Nicki’s big Instagram reveal wasn’t only about the date of her next album being pushed back. The darling diva wanted to give her fans a bit of a treat too, and let them in<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> on the name</a>! In what appears to be a tribute to her album that started it all, Nicki’s fifth studio helping will be called Pink Friday 2. The original Pink Friday, her debut studio album, was released in November 2010. Its single “Super Bass” reached number three on the US <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100 chart and skyrocketed Nicki aka Barbie to fame.</p><h2><strong>When Does Nicki Minaj’s New Album Come Out?&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h2><p id=content-paragraph-9>Along with revealing the name of her new album, Nicki gave a revised drop date and fans are hoping this is the final one. “But since I AM shifting the date just a tad, I’d like to give you guys a tiny SIP of some more album tea so that I don’t have to get cussed out 🙁” she wrote on the IG. “so…here it goes: 🎀<br>MY NEW ALBUM WILL BE RELEASED ON 11.17.23-” That’s right, folks, just in time for the holidays: November 17, 2023.</p><h2><strong>What Songs Are On Nicki Minaj’s New Album?&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h2><p id=content-paragraph-12>Although a song list has not been released, fans are betting on “Super Freaky Girl” to be a part of it. The hugely popular single is the perfect lead for it. On Aug. 13, Nicki streamed live and previewed a song from the new album, getting fans even more excited.</p><h2><strong>Who Is Featured On Nicki Minaj’s New Album?&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h2><p id=content-paragraph-15>Nicki has also released some collabs recently, like <strong>Young Thug’s</strong> <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>“Money”</a> where she rapped alongside <strong>Juice WRLD</strong>. She even shared a clip of herself lip-syncing to it <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>here</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Nicki also teamed up with the likes of rapper <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Ice Spice </strong></a>on a <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>pop single</a> featuring a sampling of <b>Aqua’s</b>&nbsp;“Barbie World” (check out our <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>exclusive interview with them here</a>) for the new <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Barbie </a>film soundtrack. The duo dropped their own “Barbie World” alongside a pink-filled music video on Jun. 23. Barbie&nbsp;and&nbsp;Barbie the Album&nbsp;will both be out on July 21.</p><p id=content-paragraph-16>Even with the high-profile collabs, there’s still no word yet on who might be in the studio with Nicki for her own album.</p><h2>When Is Nicki Minaj’s Next Tour?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-17>To accompany the album release, Nicki said a tour will kick off early next year. “I love you guys so much,” she wrote on the June 30th Instagram. “I am so grateful for the years of support & love you guys have given me. At times maybe I didn’t even deserve all that you have poured into me. Nonetheless, you. will. love. this. album. I will give tour deets closer to that time, but obviously the tour will start around the first quarter of 2024. I’ll also share the REAL album cover at a later date.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-18>The stunning rap royal also teased a tour with some big names last year. The 2021 official release of her 2009 mixtape, Beam Me Up Scotty, included a new song called “Seeing Green” with <strong>Drake</strong> and <strong>Lil Wayne</strong> that went viral. Hot off the success of the hit, Nicki said she was considering hitting the road with the two hip hop icons.</p><p id=content-paragraph-19>“Yes, of course-&nbsp;that’s been discussed many times,” Nicki told a fan about hearing “Seeing Green” played live, per <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Revolt</a>. “Really a matter of timing. Also, IDK how all 3 of us would have enough time on stage to please all of our diff fans.” She hilariously added, “Those are some&nbsp;pretty large catalogs.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-20>Nicki and Drake have both individually embarked on tours alongside Lil Wayne in the past. A super collaboration tour has yet to materialize but now Nicki has clearly given some hope to the Barbz.</p><p id=content-paragraph-21>Meanwhile, Nicki’s last tour was in 2019 when she kicked off the <b>The Nicki Wrld Tour</b> in Munich. The tour served as a support for her fourth studio album, “Queen”, and Juice Wrld’s second studio album, “Death Race for Love” (2019). It concluded on March 28, 2019, at the SEG Geneva Arena in Geneva, Switzerland after 19 shows.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme82imqRlnZ67oraMp5ywZZGhr7a5jG5oa29paH1w</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fnick-minaj-new-album-5127930.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fnick-minaj-new-album-5127930.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fnick-minaj-new-album-5127930.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fnick-minaj-new-album-5127930.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fnick-minaj-new-album-5127930.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fnick-minaj-new-album-5127930.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./parveen-kaur-2.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./parveen-kaur-2.html>Parveen Kaur Age, Net Worth, Boyfriend, Family &amp;amp; Biography</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./like-a-dragon-gaiden-mechanical-clown-location-kuidaore-taro.html>Like a Dragon Gaiden: Mechanical Clown Location [Kuidaore Taro]</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./like-a-dragon-gaiden-mechanical-clown-location-kuidaore-taro.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
