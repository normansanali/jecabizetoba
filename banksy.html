Banksy is regarded as one of the world’s most well-known graffiti artists. He combines graffiti with dark humor to create work that is worth paying attention to. He also utilizes to express his views on politics and social issues.</h3><p>So, how well-versed in Banksy are you? If not much, we’ve collated everything you need to know about Banksy’s net worth in 2021, including his age, height, weight, wife, children, biography, and personal information. Thus, if you’re ready, here’s everything we know about Banksy so far.</p><h2>What is&nbsp; Net Worth, Salary, and Earnings of&nbsp; Banksy ?</h2><p><strong>Banksy’s net worth is predicted to be around $60 million in 2021.</strong> His major source of income is graffiti art. He also makes money by directing movies.</p><h2>Early Life and Biography</h2><p>Banksy may not be the artist’s full name because he keeps his true identity hidden. Several organizations that attempted to track down his identity discovered that his real name is Robin Gunningham. His inspiration for starting his graffiti career came from admiring Blek Le Rat’s work. He and his gang were nearly apprehended vandalizing public locations when he was 18 years old. Unfortunately, as his crew fled the scene, Banksy took refuge beneath a trash lorry, which had oil gushing from the engine all over him. While he was in the area, he observed stencil lettering painted on a vehicle, and since he was seeking for a speedier technique to paint, he decided to try stenciling and make it his new graffiti style.</p><h2>Age, Height, Weight, and Body Dimensions</h2><p>So, how old is Banksy in 2021, and how tall and how heavy is he? Banksy, who was born on July 28, 1973, is 48 years old as per today’s date, August 30, 2021. Despite his height of 5′ 8′′ in feet and inches and 173 cm in centimetres, he weighs 174 pounds and 79 kg.</p><h2>Education</h2><p>Because of his obscurity, little is known about Banksy’s education. Well, he acknowledged to having had a lot of problems in school when he was younger, and after being expelled, he wandered into a life of minor crime, which led to him getting arrested and spending time in jail.</p><h2>Dating, girlfriends, wife, and kids</h2><p>The moniker ‘Banksy’ was derived from Robin Banks, according to a Sunday Times investigation. Banksy married Ms Joy Millward in Las Vegas in January of 2006, according to a new investigation by the United Kingdom Daily Mail. Both of them are said to have met in London in 2003, shortly before Ms Millward began working as a researcher for Labour MP Austin Mitchell. Sources close to the pair disclosed the lengths to which they went to avoid attracting notice. It’s unclear whether Banksy has children.</p><h3>Is Banksy a homosexual?</h3><p>Although nothing is known about Banksy’s personal life, he has been linked to one woman named Joy Millward, thus all I can deduce is that he is Straight.</p><h2>A Professional Life</h2><p>Banksy began his career as a freehand graffiti artist in 1992-1994, alongside Kato and Tes. He had moved to the skill of stenciling by the year 2000, after noticing that it took him less time to complete any of his art work. At 2003, Banksy held a show called “Turf War” in a warehouse where he painted animals. Within a year, he continued to create subversive paintings, such as Monet’s Water Lily Pond, which was altered to contain urban debris like rubbish. In 2004, he is said to have printed roughly 1 million £10 notes featuring Princess Diana’s head instead of the Queen’s. He also modified “Bank of England” to “Banksy of England” in the text. Since then, these notes have been selling for around £200 each on eBay. In 2006, two of his works were auctioned for a considerable fortune of £25000 and £50,400, respectively, breaking an auction record. Many other pieces of his art have drew attention to edgy subjects and the audacity with which they were executed. One example is the Israeli-Palestinian barrier in the West Bank, which gained a lot of media attention in 2005. Because of the soaring pricing of Banksy’s street art, a journalist named Max Foster coined the term “The Banksy Effect.” His worldwide fame has elevated his work from vandalism to collectible high art. Last but not least, his art continues to transport him throughout the globe. Other countries, such as the United States, Canada, Israel, Jamaica, Italy, Australia, and France, have enabled art to flourish and protected it.</p><h2>Awards and Achievements</h2><p>In 2014, he received the Webby Award for Person of the Year. Others included the Toronto Film Critics Association ( TFCA ) award in 2010, the Washington DC Area Film Critics Association ( WAFCA ) award in 2010, the Indiewire Critics’ Poll ( ICP ) award in 2010, the Film Independent Spirit Awards ( FISA ) award in 2011, and the Cinema Eye Honors Awards in the United States in 2011.</p><h2>Some Interesting Facts of Banksy</h2><ul><li>His work, thoughts, and ideas were collected in a book titled “wall and piece.”</li><li>He does not use commercial art galleries to market his work.</li><li>He didn’t claim his award since he didn’t want to reveal his true identity. In 2007, it was awarded to the finest living British artist.</li><li>In 2008, one of his works of art sold for $1.7 million at an auction.</li><li>Year after year, the worth of his work increases.</li><li>He self-describes as a “quality vandal.”</li></ul><p>Banksy is a powerful character who relates with the groups who are looked down upon by society’s wealthy and mighty. His charitable work of donating his resources to aid in the research of eye ailments and the restoration of sight to the blind is admirable.</p><h2>Facts of Banksy</h2><table><tbody><tr><td width=309>Real Name/Full Name</td><td width=309>Banksy</td></tr><tr><td width=309>Nick Name/Celebrated Name:</td><td width=309>Banksy</td></tr><tr><td width=309>Birth Place:</td><td width=309>Bristol</td></tr><tr><td width=309>Date Of Birth/Birthday:</td><td width=309>28 July 1973</td></tr><tr><td width=309>Age/How Old:</td><td width=309>48 years old</td></tr><tr><td width=309>Height/How Tall:</td><td width=309>In Centimetres – 173&nbsp;cm<br>In Feet and Inches – 5′ 8″</td></tr><tr><td width=309>Weight:</td><td width=309>In Kilograms – 79&nbsp;Kg<br>In Pounds – 174lbs</td></tr><tr><td width=309>Eye Color:</td><td width=309>N/A</td></tr><tr><td width=309>Hair Color:</td><td width=309>N/A</td></tr><tr><td width=309>Parents Name:</td><td width=309>Father&nbsp;– N/A<br>Mother – N/A</td></tr><tr><td width=309>Siblings:</td><td width=309>N/A</td></tr><tr><td width=309>School:</td><td width=309>Bristol Cathedral School</td></tr><tr><td width=309>College:</td><td width=309>N/A</td></tr><tr><td width=309>Religion:</td><td width=309>N/A</td></tr><tr><td width=309>Nationality:</td><td width=309>British</td></tr><tr><td width=309>Zodiac Sign:</td><td width=309>Leo</td></tr><tr><td width=309>Gender:</td><td width=309>Male</td></tr><tr><td width=309>Sexual Orientation:</td><td width=309>Straight</td></tr><tr><td width=309>Marital Status:</td><td width=309>Married</td></tr><tr><td width=309>Girlfriend:</td><td width=309>N/A</td></tr><tr><td width=309>Wife/Spouse Name:</td><td width=309>Joy Millward</td></tr><tr><td width=309>Kids/Children Name:</td><td width=309>N/A</td></tr><tr><td width=309>Profession:</td><td width=309>England street Artist, Film Director, Political activist</td></tr><tr><td width=309>Net Worth:</td><td width=309>$60 million</td></tr></tbody></table><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmion6XCra3Rp5ytr5%2Bnwal6wqikaJqRo7i0xY4%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbanksy.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fbanksy.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fbanksy.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fbanksy.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbanksy.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbanksy.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./can-my-unvaccinated-puppy-play-in-my-backyard.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./can-my-unvaccinated-puppy-play-in-my-backyard.html>Can my unvaccinated puppy play in my backyard?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./are-lincolns-good-used-cars.html>Are lincolns good used cars</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./are-lincolns-good-used-cars.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
