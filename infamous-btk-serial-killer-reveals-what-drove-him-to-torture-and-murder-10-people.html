worked with Katherine Ramsland, a forensic psychology professor at DeSales University, to publish a book - <i>Confession of a Serial Killer: The Untold Story of Dennis Rader, the BTK Killer</i> - about his crimes in 2016.</p><p>She wrote the book under an agreement that proceeds from its sale goes to the victims' families trust fund.</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading

her upside down in her home before he was arrested.</p><p>Rader wrote three-and-a-half pages of the book about his plans for his last kill.</p><p>"This was supposed to be my opus, my grand finale, and to make it different, I would set the house on fire using propane canisters," he wrote.</p><p>He said he got into the woman's backyard and knocked on her door, but aborted his plan when a city street crew showed up unexpectedly to work outside the house.</p><p>Rader planned to kill her the following spring, but was arrested in February 2005.</p><p>Wichita police detectives who captured Rader in

had heard the story from Rader himself in 2005, but decided at the time to suppress the information to protect the woman.</p><p>"For him to reveal this information now is cruel," Tim Relph, a former BTK task force investigator, said when the book was released.</p><p>Police said they suppressed most of the details of the planned murder for 11 years because they feared what the shock of a public revelation might do to the woman.</p><p>But authorities did inform the woman after finding out that defense attorneys for Rader had hired investigators who might contact her.</p><p>"She's a pretty tough lady, but this shook her up quite a bit," Relph said.</p><p>Following his arrest, several of the victims' relatives sued Rader and secured a settlement that agreed he could never profit from his crimes or coverage of them.</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with
