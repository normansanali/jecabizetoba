He is currently <strong>31 years old</strong>. Sam was born to Fredrick Smith and Kate Cassidy, who is a stockbroker. Smith’s father was a stay-at-home dad and his mother was a successful banker. The singer attended the ‘St. Mary’s Catholic School is located in Bishop’s Stortford. At the age of 8, the singer learned to sing under a jazz pianist named ‘Joanna Eden’ at Saffron Walden in Essex and later joined a jazz band.</p><p>Smith started singing from a very early age and joined the ‘Cantate Youth Choir’. And the ‘Bishop’s Stortford Junior Operatics’ which later came to be known as ‘Bishop’s Stortford Musical Theater Society.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-40185 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/fresherpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Sam-Smith-mom.jpg alt="Sam Smith" width=650 height=812 data-sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-40185 class=wp-caption-text>Caption: Sam Smith’s childhood picture with his mom.

So yeah, I think I had it.”</p><p>Smith says they caught the bug while in the U.K., but as many others self-diagnosed stayed in and let nature take its course. He said their sister also began exhibiting symptoms of COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus, while they were living together. The pair decided to self-isolate for three weeks, and have since recovered.</p><p>“I’ve got an older Nan, so we didn’t want to risk anything,” Sam said to Lowe. Smith’s decision to self-isolate came before the UK imposed strict social-distancing measures in March, which have since been extended for at least another three weeks. Sam added, “As everyone was kind of really on lockdown, that’s when I got over it, luckily.”</p><h4>Self-isolation times</h4><p>With the doors closed to the outside world, Smith needed a release. The Brit felt the urge to sing and create. “The first two weeks, I just wanted to sing. I don’t want to sing my songs, I don’t want to sing and film them. I just want to walk around the house and sing.” In week three of self-quarantine, Smith lost the urge.</p><p>Smith is back in form, releasing a new collaboration with Demi Lovato, “I’m Ready,” and performing a duet with John Legend for the historic Together At a Home concert this past weekend.</p><p>Smith previously decided to rename and postpone the release of their upcoming album, originally called “To Die For.” The “Stay With Me” crooner told Lowe it’s “ready to go whenever this all calms down,” but said they have “no idea” when they might announce a new name or release date. “These whole last two years for me have been two years of transitioning. I’m used to this feeling of trying different stuff,” Smith said.</p><h2><span id=Professional_Life>Professional Life</span></h2><p>Smith’s first moment in the spotlight would come when the dance/electronica duo Disclosure released its 2012 song “<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Latch</a>,” to which Smith lent their vocals. The track featured the singer’s melodic falsetto over Disclosure’s electronic beat. “Latch”, stars a stripped-down sound that made the listener take notice of Smith’s vocal work. It resonated in a big way with music fans and critics alike and laid the groundwork for their future success in the UK and beyond.</p><p>“Latch” entered the top of the UK singles chart when Smith was just 21. The singer soon released their single, “Lay Me Down”. Sam’s next hit was again via a featured role on another artist’s song: Naughty Boy’s Bollywood-inspired “La La La”. Along with Smith’s lead vocal, the song became an instant No. 1 single in the UK in the spring of 2013.</p><p>In the fall, Smith released their first EP, Nirvana, on which listeners were treated to an acoustic version of “Latch”. After some months, in February 2014, Smith was again at the top of the UK singles chart with “Money on My Mind”. And in May 2014, the singer’s full-length debut ‘In the Lonely Hour, was released in the UK.</p><h4>Coming Out and Awards Success</h4><p>The same month that ‘In the Lonely Hour was released, Smith came out as gay. The singer also revealed that despite the album being full of love songs, Smith’s never experienced it firsthand.</p><p>“I’ve never been in a relationship before,” they said to the magazine Fader.</p><p>“In the Lonely Hour is about a guy that I fell in love with last year, and he didn’t love me back. … I was in a very dark place.”</p><p>Further, that dark place has taken Smith to some very exciting, rewarding arenas. Similarly, at the 2015 Grammy Awards, Smith and their record took four awards: Best New Artist, Best Pop Vocal Album, Record of the Year, and Song of the Year (“Stay With Me”).</p><p>“Before I made this record I was doing everything to try and get my music heard,” Smith said during one of his four acceptance speeches.</p><p>“It was only until I started to be myself that the music started to flow and people started to listen.”</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-40186 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/fresherpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Sam-Smith-performance.jpg alt="Sam Smith" width=650 height=412 data-sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-40186 class=wp-caption-text>Caption: Sam Smith while performing. Source: Name</p><h4>More Disclosure and James Bond</h4><p>Smith remained to be busy in 2015, releasing a re-recorded version of “Lay Me Down” as a duet with soul singer John Legend. The record went to No.1 on the UK pop charts while raising money for the charity initiative Comic Relief. Then, Smith contributed lead vocals on the sleek “Omen”, one of the first singles from Disclosure’s sophomore album, ‘Caracal’.</p><p>Smith has since joined the James Bond canon of movie vocalists with his orchestral single “Writing’s on the Wall” for Spectre. Co-written with Jimmy Napes, the song became a No. 1 single in the UK. “Wall” won both a Golden Globe and an Academy Award in 2016, with Smith dedicating his Oscar win to LGBT communities across the globe.</p><h4>Second Album: ‘The Thrill of It All</h4><p>In September 2017, Smith released the first track, “Too Good at Goodbyes,” from their sophomore album ‘The Thrill of It All. Three more singles followed from the album, which hit No. 1 in the UK and U.S. Smith enjoyed more commercial success via collaborations with Calvin Harris on “Promises”.</p><p>And with Normani on “Dancing with a Stranger”, before resuming solo work for the summer 2019 release of “How Do You Sleep?” and releasing a cover of Donna Summer’s “I Feel Love” late in the year. Smith followed in February 2020 with the single “To Die For,” also expected to be the title of their upcoming album.</p><p>However, the artist announced in March that they were changing the album name. Also delaying its release due to concerns about the coronavirus outbreak.</p><h4>The decision to use Non-Binary Pronouns</h4><p>In 2019, Smith announced that they were going to begin using the non-gender, non-binary pronouns they/them.</p><p>“After a lifetime of being at war with my gender, I’ve decided to embrace myself for who I am, inside and out. I’m so excited and privileged to be surrounded by people that support me in this decision but I’ve been very nervous about announcing this because I care too much about what people think,” Smith wrote on Instagram.</p><h2><span id=Sam_Smith_8211_Brand_Endorsements>Sam Smith – Brand Endorsements</span></h2><p>Being a well-known celebrity, he has been involved in endorsing some popular brands and products.
