Tasting this gluten free banana bread, youâ€™d never guess that it wasnâ€™t made with wheat flour. Itâ€™s moist, tender, and filled with spiced banana flavor. In fact, if I did a side-by-side comparison with my regular Healthy Banana Bread, I wouldnâ€™t be able to choose a favorite! Weâ€™re getting some sunshine in Chicago today, but for the last week, itâ€™s been cool and rainy.

Jack and I have made regular homemade pizza for years, but this spring, this cast iron pizza recipe took our pizza game to a whole new level. Itâ€™s the closest youâ€™ll ever come to making restaurant-style pizza without a fancy oven or pizza stone. Thanks to the hot skillet, the crust becomes crisp and browned on the outside, while the thick edges stay nice and chewy in the middle. We madeâ€¦</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Looking back now, I canâ€™t believe that there was a time when I hadnâ€™t heard of migas. Growing up in the Midwest, I ate muffins for breakfast every morning. When I went to college, I started each day with a bowl of oatmeal.&nbsp;If you asked me where to find great migas, I would have looked at you like you were crazy. But in Austin, migas are everywhere. Go out to brunch, and theyâ€™ll be on the menu. Stop at a taco truck in the morning, and everyone there will be getting migas breakfast tacos. It didnâ€™t take me long toâ€¦</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>If I learned one thing from living in Austin, itâ€™s that homemade salsa is infinitely better than any kind you can find in a jar. I loved sampling salsas at restaurants and taco trucks. Each one was different â€“ some were made with roasted ingredients, others got a smoky, spicy kick from dried chiles, and still others were nice and fresh. This variety inspired me to start experimenting with making homemade salsa. I might pull out dried chiles in the winter, when good tomatoes are hard to find, or roast tomatillos if I see them at the farmers market. Butâ€¦</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>This Mediterranean quinoa salad recipe is fresh and flavorful. Itâ€™s a delicious addition to the menu of any potluck, cookout, or picnic. It can easily pass as a side dish, but itâ€™s so hearty and satisfying that it can be the main event, too. And if you happen to have leftovers, youâ€™re in luck! This quinoa salad keeps well if you make it ahead of time, so itâ€™s a great recipe to meal prep for healthy lunches throughout the week. Over the years, Iâ€™ve shared lots of quinoa salad recipes on the blog, but Iâ€™m especially smitten with this one.â€¦</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Move over, bottled Italian dressing! This homemade Italian dressing recipe is super easy to make, and it tastes far better than any store bought kind. Trust me, I know. Growing up in the Midwest, I tried bottled Italian salad dressings left and right. They were a staple at the salad bar, the secret ingredient in everyoneâ€™s pasta salad, and the default marinade for any protein. I get it. Reaching for a bottle of pre-made dressing is quick and easy. But once you try this homemade Italian dressing recipe, youâ€™ll wonâ€™t look back.

Growing up, they were a fixture in my momâ€™s regular recipe rotation, right alongside creamy broccoli soup, eggplant Parmesan, and mac and cheese. Back then, Iâ€™d eat the filling, made from ground beef, Italian seasoning, tomato sauce, and rice, and push aside the pepper. In hindsight, itâ€™s not hard to see why people were surprised when I became a vegetarian. ðŸ™‚ Since then, Iâ€™ve learned that the pepper itself is an integral part of any stuffed peppers recipe.&nbsp;Donâ€™t get me wrong, the fillingâ€¦</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>This edible cookie dough recipe is almost&nbsp;too&nbsp;easy to make. I donâ€™t know about you, but every so often, I have days when I need a cookie, and I need one now. Most of the time, I whip up my go-to vegan chocolate chip cookies, but lately, itâ€™s been too hot to turn on the oven. While I know that baking is out of the question on a sticky summer day, my cookie cravings couldnâ€™t care less. Enter: edible cookie dough. It has all the rich, chocolatey goodness of a regular cookie, but you donâ€™t have to turn on the ovenâ€¦</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>This grilled peaches recipe sums up everything about what makes cooking in late summer so special. Fresh peaches are already at their best â€“ sweet, juicy, and tender â€“ so the smallest effort transforms them into a delectable dessert. I love standing outside as they cook, soaking in the warm weather while itâ€™s still here. When theyâ€™re ready (they only take 3 minutes!), I scoop them off the grill, top them with vanilla ice cream, toasted nuts, and fresh herbs, and dig in while theyâ€™re still hot.

Jack and I would visit farms near Austin, where we lived at the time, and come home with armfuls of summer veggies like zucchini and eggplant. Weâ€™d get the grill pan nice and hot (this was before we had an outdoor grill), and cook everything until it was tender and perfectly charred. Weâ€™d drizzle on a tasty sauce, pass some crusty bread, and call it dinner. So much has changed since then â€“ weâ€¦</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Every time I make this ratatouille recipe, I think about a trip I took to Provence, France, a few years ago. While I was there, I stayed with a local family. When they met me at the train station, I was exhausted and hungry, worn out from hours of traveling alone. But when my hosts announced that they were serving ratatouille for dinner, I felt my energy come flooding back. Iâ€™ve always loved ratatouille, a ProvenÃ§al vegetable stew, and I was so excited to try it in France!
