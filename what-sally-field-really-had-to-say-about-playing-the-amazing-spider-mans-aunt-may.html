For example, it can be easy to overlook the fact that stars spend a lot of time promoting their projects. During press junkets, stars spend their time singing the praises of the project they are there to promote. As a result, it can be quite rare to hear how an actor feels about their project, at least at first.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Of course, some actors have been around for so long that they’ve earned the right to tell the truth about the movies they starred in years earlier. For example, Jamie Foxx once revealed that when he promoted his movie Stealth, he knew the movie wasn’t good but he had to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">lie about its quality</a> in order to promote it. Just like Jamie Foxx, the legendary actor Sally Field tends to be honest about what she thinks of the films she has made.</p><p>If you are looking for an example of Sally Field expressing how she really feels about a pair of films she starred in, you need to read what she had to say about playing Aunt May. A legendary character that Field brought to life in the Amazing Spider-Man films, based on what Sally once said about the character, she didn’t find the role very rewarding.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Arnold Schwarzenegger Thinks This Is "The Worst Movie" He Ever Starred In</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=beloved-character-fantastic-actors>Beloved Character, Fantastic Actors</h2><p>Because Spider-Man is one of the most beloved superheroes in history, several of his supporting characters have become world-famous. For example, anyone who has even a passing knowledge of Spider-Man is bound to be familiar with characters like Mary Jane and Aunt May. While a lot of actors have voiced Aunt May over the years, only three actors have portrayed the character in live-action big-budget movies.</p><p>First brought to life on the big screen by Rosemary Harris, she did a wonderful job embuing Aunt May with an inner strength and obvious kindness in Sam Raimi’s Spider-Man trilogy. Next portrayed by Sally Field in the Amazing Spider-Man movies, seeing Aunt May be embodied by such a legendary performer was truly amazing. Most recently played by Marisa Tomei in the <strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Marvel Cinematic Universe</a></strong>, her version of the character arguably is a lot more fun than the previous ones.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Marisa Tomei's Hollywood Career In 20 Pics</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=speaking-her-truth>Speaking Her Truth</h2><p>In 2016, Sally Field made an appearance on The Howard Stern Show. During Field and Stern’s wide-ranging conversation that took part in that day, her tenure playing Aunt May in the Amazing Spider-Man movies came up. Amazingly enough, Field <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">didn’t hold anything back</a> when talking about the process of making those two films.</p><p>Asked whether or not she likes the Amazing Spider-Man films, Field instantly responded; “Not especially” before explaining they are “not (her) kind of movie”. From there, Stern asked Field if she put a lot of thought into playing Aunt May to which Field responded; “Not a great deal”. Still not through, Field went on to explain why she didn’t put that much effort into the project. “It’s really hard to find a three-dimensional character in it, and you work it as much as you can, but you can’t put ten pounds of s**t in a five-pound bag.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When you simply read Sally Field’s words about the Amazing Spider-Man movies, they may come off as unnecessarily harsh. However, if you <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">listen to the audio of that interview</a>, Field had nothing but kindness in her voice.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The One Movie Michelle Pfeiffer Hated Starring In</a></span></p><h2 id=sally-s-love-for-her-co-workers>Sally’s Love For Her Co-Workers</h2><p>Given how Sally Field felt about playing Aunt May, you may be left wondering why she took the role, to begin with. During the aforementioned Howard Stern interview, Field explained that being a part of the film allowed her to work with an important figure in her life once again. “My friend Laura Ziskin was the producer, and we knew it would be her last film, and she was my first producing partner, and she was a spectacular human.” Ultimately, Field’s friend Laura Ziskin would pass away mere months after principal photography on the first Amazing Spider-Man film finished.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On top of the Amazing Spider-Man films giving Sally Field the chance to work with an old friend again, she definitely enjoyed working with one of her co-stars in particular. During an interview with Clevver Movies, Field <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">gushed about</a> who Garfield is as a person and her respect for the work ethic he displayed behind the scenes.</p><p>“I’m just glad to see, we’re at the tail end of the shoot, that he’s still alive. It was a really long and grueling shoot for him and he’s just a diamond, he really is, just a gem. Ah, and he was s so fun to work with. So into everything. So intense. So intense. Um, and takes it all so seriously, which is fabulous to work with.”</p><p>While there are a lot of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">different opinions</a> about how good or bad Andrew Garfield was at playing Spider-Man, Sally Field clearly has the utmost respect for his efforts.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here's Why Andrew Garfield Was Paid Only $500,000 For 'The Amazing Spider-Man'</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYsCiuMuyZJ%2BhlaGxbr7EmqOlsV2drqV506hkrJmpYq6ju9StZKmkka62r7OMrZ%2BeZZGirru1zaBkrKiZmbKzecyapaxlkaq7tXnMmrBo</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-sally-field-really-had-to-say-about-playing-the-amazing-spider-mans-aunt-may.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhat-sally-field-really-had-to-say-about-playing-the-amazing-spider-mans-aunt-may.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhat-sally-field-really-had-to-say-about-playing-the-amazing-spider-mans-aunt-may.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhat-sally-field-really-had-to-say-about-playing-the-amazing-spider-mans-aunt-may.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-sally-field-really-had-to-say-about-playing-the-amazing-spider-mans-aunt-may.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-sally-field-really-had-to-say-about-playing-the-amazing-spider-mans-aunt-may.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./who-is-arne-sorenson-wife-everything-on-family-net-worth-and-cause-of-death.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./who-is-arne-sorenson-wife-everything-on-family-net-worth-and-cause-of-death.html>Who Is Arne Sorenson Wife?
