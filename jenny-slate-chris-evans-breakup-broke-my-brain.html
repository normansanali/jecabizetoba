Pratt was the born-again one from Parks & Rec; Hemsworth was the absurdly hot Australian one from Thor, and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Evans</a> and Pine were ... forgettable — middle of the road, interchangeable hunky bros from action movies I’d maybe watch if I got really desperate on an airplane. Because I have eyes and ears, I was ride-or-die Team Hemsworth. Case closed.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">But then <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Jenny Slate</a> swooped in.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-they-met></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How They Met</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The saga began in October on the set of the movie Gifted (which approximately seven people have seen despite its solid score on <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Rotten Tomatoes</a>). Evans and Slate were beginning to regularly hang out — chaperoned by costar Octavia Spencer — during weekly cast game nights in Savannah, Georgia.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Flirty Twitter banter ensued, although at the time Slate was married to Dean Fleischer-Camp, her Marcel the Shell with Shoes On co-creator. By April 2016, Evans and Slate appeared together on Anna Faris’ “Unqualified” <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>podcast</a>, where their chemistry was electric and Evans said things like, “I’ve only known Jenny for a few months, which is insane to say because we’re like the same animal.”</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-the-coupling></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>The Coupling</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Shortly thereafter, Slate promptly split from her husband, making her first public appearance with Evans as a couple at the Secret Life of Pets premiere (speaking of animals) in June 2016.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">That entire journey was enough to truly throw everything I thought I knew about the world out of whack. If Jenny Slate, queen of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>quirky stop motion</a> and my entry point into the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>A24 canon</a>, could call squeaky clean baseball hat-wearing Captain America her “dream 7th grade boyfriend,” “beautiful inside and out,” what does that mean for bros everywhere? Was I wrong in writing off my potential compatibility with beer-guzzling sports superfans? Or was Evans just a mystical creature, an anomaly in the bro/nerd dichotomy?</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Dave Alloca/Shutterstock</span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-the-uncoupling></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>The Uncoupling</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">I didn’t have too much time to think about it because by February 2017, Evans and Slate had called it quits. You’d think that would be the end of that, an opposites-attract flash in the pan. But then the interviews started coming out as the pair had to finally promote that fateful movie they made. Slate <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>called</a> Evans “truly one of the kindest people I’ve ever met, to the point where sometimes I would look at him and it would kind of break my heart,” and Evans threw it right back, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>saying</a> things like “I am endlessly grateful for having met her. She will be in my life always … We were both rooting for this. She’s an incredible human being, a very, very special person. We’re all lucky she’s so driven, she’s going to make some amazing art in her life.”</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-the-re-couplingand-final-breakup></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>The Re-Coupling...and Final Breakup</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Wow. As our collective hearts (or maybe it was just mine) swelled, the plot thickened. In November 2017, Slate and Evans were both in Atlanta shooting their respective superhero movies (the fact that Jenny is technically part of the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Marvel</a> universe still blows my mind) when Chris tweeted the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>infamous Dodger (the dog) video</a>. In it, you can faintly hear a very familiar lady laughing in the background. I watched said video on loop, feeling the kind of blind hope I thought I had left in my teens. To my delight and relief, it was confirmed that they got back together just in time for the holidays.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">But by March, they were off again for good, confirmed in a <i>New York Times</i> <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>profile</a> of Evans in which he mentioned learning he needs to “listen more and speak less” from reading Rebecca Solnit while still with Slate. (Attention all men: please file this under “how to talk about your exes.”)</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-where-they-are-today></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Where They Are Today</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Fast forward to today. Jenny is thriving career-wise and married Ben Shattuck, an artist guy with a bunch of awards and residencies, on New Year's Eve of 2021. Earlier that year, they also welcomed a daughter named Ida.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In my heart of hearts, I know this is probably an “all is right in the jungle” situation for our favorite little weirdo, but I’m not sure I’ll ever shake the feeling that Evans is her true mismatch match. Either way, it was official: I had spent two years of my life invested in a Hollywood Chris I had previously written off as just another white guy. The scars on my heart may heal, but my brain has been permanently rewired.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Luckily, our man Captain America has been on a multi-year campaign to show the world his true colors post-breakup — he’s been busy as hell posting endless <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>content</a> of his perfect dog, convincing us all to buy deadstock Irish wool <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>sweaters</a>, professing his <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3>love</a> for Stanley Tucci, oh and also doing <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=4>press</a> for his <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=5>startup</a>, which is focused on creating a more informed American electorate.
