The Island of Misfit Toys was a place where unwanted or unloved toys go to live.</p><p>After being cast out by their respective tribes, the trio turns to each other for companionship. During their travels through the North Pole, they accidentally land on the Island of Misfit Toys, where those that are broken or unwanted go to live until they can find a child who will love them.</p><h2>What animals are in the jack in the box?</h2><p>Residents include a jack-in-the-box named<strong> Charlie, a spotted elephant, a choo-choo train with square wheels on the caboose, a water pistol that shoots jelly, a bird that doesn’t fly, a cowboy who rides an ostrich, and a boat that can’t stay afloat.</strong></p><p>It’s been<strong> 55 years</strong> since Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer first premiered on NBC, and watching the beloved TV special is still a Christmastime tradition for many families. You couldn’t ask for a more inspiring gang of outsiders than Rudolph, wannabe dentist/elf Hermey, and everyone’s favorite prospector, Yukon Cornelius.</p><p>As<strong> the special underwent revisions over the years,</strong> Dolly got more screen time and lines, making her lack of a physical defect more apparent.

Two years before his death, Arthur was asked about what makes Rudolph timeless. “I really don’t have an answer to that,” he confessed.</p><h2>What is the island of misfit toys?</h2><p>The Island of Misfit Toys was<strong> a place where unwanted or unloved toys go to live.</strong> These toys usually have some form of defect or were just created differently, like a spotted elephant, a lion with wings, a train with square wheels, and a water pistol that shot jelly. Whether by manufacturing defect or damage, they don’t say, but if we were to follow the logic of the movie’s universe, wherein all toys in the world are made independently at Santa’s workshop, then it’s fair to say that these toys were discarded by Santa himself.</p><p>Most millennials will probably be aware of the phrase “Welcome to the Island of Misfit Toys”, made popular by Stephen Chbosky’s book<strong> The Perks of Being a Wallflower,</strong> which was turned into a highly successful teen movie.
