Also, meet his wife, Bernita Landry.</p><h2><span id=Troy-Landry-Net-Worth-in-2023-2-Million><b>Troy Landry Net Worth in 2023 $2 Million.</b></span></h2><p><span>With reliable sources backing us up, Troy Landry’s net worth is $2 million. The pioneer of the show gets paid a salary of $25,000 for each episode aired.</span></p><p><span>But that’s not all. The series racked up millions of viewers across the globe prompting for the executives to initiate two spin-offs. One called Outback Hunters based in – you guessed it – Australia; and the second called Swamp Mysteries with Troy Landry which debuted in July last year.</span></p><p><span>In addition to taking center stage on both reality programs, the gator hunter also earns a lot from the merchandise linked to the show. He also gets dividends from the incorporation of his voice into the game Angry Swamp.</span></p><p><span>Moreover, the TV star also owns a restaurant which also stretches his net worth by a mile. We’ll highlight it next.</span></p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-2506 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/realitystarfacts.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Troy-Landry-of-Swamp-People.jpg alt="Image of Swamp People cast Troy Landry net worth is $2 million" width=600 height=418 sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p id=caption-attachment-2506 class=wp-caption-text><strong>Swamp People cast Troy Landry net worth is $2 million</strong></p><h3><span id=Troy-Landry-Career-Info><b>Troy Landry Career Info</b></span></h3><p><span>The enigmatic star wasn’t always enthusiastic as he is today on the show. He had ever done his hunting alone or sometimes with his small crew.</span></p><p><span>So, when the agents from the History Channel approached him for a career in television, he turned them down severally.</span></p><p><span>His mindset was already fixated on the idea that only fishers and a few sailors with cable would be his audience. As you already know, this was never the case.</span></p><p><span>It was through the intervention of his wife that he softened up to the idea of cameras following him around during hunting.</span></p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-14844 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wikicelebinfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Troy-Landry-show.jpg alt="Image of Troy Landry from Swamp People show" width=600 height=533 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p id=caption-attachment-14844 class=wp-caption-text><strong>Troy Landry from Swamp People show</strong></p><p><span>They shot the first season in 2009 and officially aired it the following year in August 2010. It had an audience of 4.2 million viewers and is currently one of the best shows on the History Channel.</span></p><h3><span id=Swamp-People-Troy-Landry-House-Cars-Businesses><b>Swamp People Troy Landry House, Cars, Businesses</b></span></h3><p><span>When it comes to the best seafood restaurant in Louisiana, Troy Landry’s Seafood House is the place you want to visit. If you’re also wondering whether gator meat tastes like fried chicken, Troy is the right person to talk to about that.</span></p><p><span>The joint is open for gator meat, crabs, crawfish, frogs, turtles; you name it. He also operates his father’s gas station called Duffy’s and undoubtedly refers his customers to try out seafood at his place. Talk about business strategies.</span></p><p><span>Speaking of places, the gator hunter lives in Pierre Part, Louisiana in an all wood built house. Troy Landry from ‘Swamp People’ lived in a trailer with his wife Bernita and their three sons for 30 years while he collected the wood to make it. Once he had enough resources and labor from Danny and a contractor named Elson Templet, the work began.</span></p><p><span>The house is now a tourist destination as it purely made of Cypress and sits on their 3-acre farm. The finishing touches include a 30 by 34 feet spacious family room with 13 white-tailed Deer heads. It also has a 12-foot dining table, custom designed bedrooms and much more. Occasionally, they often receive visitors from the wild in the bayou coming out to sunbathe.</span></p><h2><span id=Troy-Landry-Married-is-to-a-wife-Bernita-Landry><b>Troy Landry Married is to a wife, Bernita Landry.</b></span></h2><p><span>The one person we really ought to thank for setting this wheel in motion is Troy Landry’s wife, Bernita Landry. She was born on July 16th, 1958, and attended the Patterson High School.</span></p><p><span>Later on in life, the couple met, fell in love and tied the knot producing two of the star’s son’; Jacob and Chase.</span></p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-14846 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wikicelebinfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Troy-Landry-sons.jpg alt="Image of Troy Landry son Jacob and Chase." width=600 height=400 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p id=caption-attachment-14846 class=wp-caption-text><strong>Troy Landry son Jacob and Chase.</strong></p><p><span>So what about Brandon? Well, he goes by his Surname Hotard which comes from his father. Brandon isn’t biologically Troy’s, but he is one of his sons.</span></p><p><span>He was part of the show until 2012 when he ventured out into other areas of work. Nevertheless, the Choot’em star passed down generations worth of skills in hunting down to all three of his sons.</span></p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-14845 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wikicelebinfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Troy-Landry-wife.jpg alt="Image of Troy Landry with his wife Bernita Landry" width=600 height=546 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p id=caption-attachment-14845 class=wp-caption-text><strong>Troy Landry with his wife, Bernita Landry</strong></p><p><span>Back to his wife Bernita, the mother of three started her career as a bank teller at the Patterson State Bank.

He commemorates his birthday each year on June 9th with the most recent celebration after hitting the age of 63. The gator hunter learned everything he knows from his parents, Duffy and Myrtle.</span></p><p><span>However, he’s not the only one to drink from the cup of knowledge. Troy Landry has two siblings named Guy and Bubba Landry who all grew up with him at the Atchafalaya river basin of Louisiana.</span></p><p><span>&nbsp;The best part about Landry Family is that we get to the whole family in action in Swamp People. The only thing scrapped out from his bio is whether or not and where he got his formal education.</span></p><p><b>Summary</b></p><p><span>Troy Landry is the man behind Swamp People. It’s incredible to see how much Troy Landry has built his net worth from a modest budget during the short hunting season. His wife, family, and fans all thank him for that</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiqlZa5qsDYrKuaqpaWsLW%2FjZympmekp7y6ecuapZ2qqWQ%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftroy-landry.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2ftroy-landry.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2ftroy-landry.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2ftroy-landry.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftroy-landry.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftroy-landry.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./lyrics-urhobo-hymn-joy-to-the-world.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./lyrics-urhobo-hymn-joy-to-the-world.html>Urhobo hymn joy to the world lyrics</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./taylor-armstrong.html>Taylor Armstrong Age, Net worth: Kids, Wife, Bio-Wiki, Weight</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./taylor-armstrong.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
