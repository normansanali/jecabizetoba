The rookie proved himself as he earned a series of accolades and resigned with the team, earning a significant pay raise. Thompson agreed to a five-year contract for $82 million.</p><p>One year after signing his extension, Thompson and the Cavaliers got a taste of victory. The team won the championship in 2016. Thompson remained in Cleveland until 2020. Following the 2019-2020 season, Thompson entered free agency and signed a two-year, $19 million contract with the Boston Celtics. However, his time in Boston was cut short as he was traded to the Sacramento Kings in August 2021.</p><p>Following the trade, Thompson struggled to find a place on the team. In February 2022, he was traded from Sacramento to the Indiana Pacers. After playing four games with the Pacers, the team and Thompson reached a mutual contract buyout agreement. Thompson ultimately took a pay cut to be released from the team. He went on to sign a one-year million-dollar deal with the Chicago Bulls.</p><p>After finishing his term with the Bulls, Thompson went unsigned for most of the 2022-2023 season. However, the <a href=#>Los Angeles Lakers signed Thompson</a> at the end of the year looking to expand their roster for the playoffs. He signed a $16,700 contract for the remaining season and <a href=#>played in six games</a>. The move was beneficial for Thompson as he was <a href=#>physically closer</a> to ex <strong>Khloé Kardashian</strong> and their two children: True, 6, and Tatum, 20 months.</p><p>In September 2023, Thompson returned to his initial team and signed a one-year deal with the Cavaliers for $3,196,448. Despite his good fortune, the athlete suffered his fair share of setbacks. In January, Thompson was <a href=#>suspended for 25 games</a> without pay after testing positive for performance-enhancing drugs.</p><p>Two months after the PED scandal, a court ruled that Thompson had to pay his ex <strong>Maralee Nichols</strong> <a href=#>back child support</a> after allegedly missing multiple payments. According to court documents obtained by The Sun, Thompson is required to pay Nichols, 32, $57,916 after missing several payments between September 2023 and January 2024. Us Weekly reached out for comment at the time.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Nichols welcomed son Theo, 2, in December 2021. Days before Nichols gave birth, news broke that Thompson was the father of her then-unborn baby when she sued him for child support. He had initially denied her claims before a paternity test proved otherwise. At the time, Thompson was still dating Kardashian, 39, and the pair had recently done an embryo transfer with a surrogate to conceive their second child together.</p><p>In addition to his children with Kardashian and Nichols, Thompson is also the father of son Prince, 7, with ex <strong>Jordan Craig</strong>. He has been <a href=#>accused of not paying child support</a> for Prince as well, according to Craig’s sister. Thompson never publicly addressed the allegations.</p><p>He also has <a href=#>guardianship for his youngest brother</a> Amari, 18m who suffers from epilepsy, after their mother died in January 2023.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKCnq5mZsm7A0aKqrZmeYsGpu8ypqqimo2K7o62MrJilmaKueqK6w2afqK9dosKktIyhnGalkaCytHnPnqlmsZWWv3A%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2finside-tristan-thompsons-nba-salary-and-how-much-he-makes-per-year.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2finside-tristan-thompsons-nba-salary-and-how-much-he-makes-per-year.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2finside-tristan-thompsons-nba-salary-and-how-much-he-makes-per-year.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2finside-tristan-thompsons-nba-salary-and-how-much-he-makes-per-year.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2finside-tristan-thompsons-nba-salary-and-how-much-he-makes-per-year.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2finside-tristan-thompsons-nba-salary-and-how-much-he-makes-per-year.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./jomo-kenyatta-biography-age-family-quotes-real-name-death-parents-university-and-wives.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./jomo-kenyatta-biography-age-family-quotes-real-name-death-parents-university-and-wives.html>Jomo Kenyatta Biography: Age, Family, Quotes, Real Name, Death, Parents, University And Wives</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./cleo-wade-net-worth-261444.html>Cleo Wade Net Worth 2024</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./cleo-wade-net-worth-261444.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
