One such distress signal was created by the&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>Canadian Women's Foundation</a>, a nonprofit that assists women and girls experiencing violence and poverty. It was developed in during the COVID-19 pandemic so that victims of domestic abuse could discreetly ask for help without alerting their abusers or leaving a digital trace, especially at a time when domestic violence was on the rise due to lockdowns.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"It really speaks to the power of this signal and the idea that we need to have something to help us make sure that people are safe," Andrea Gunraj, the Canadian Women's Foundation's vice president of public engagement,&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>told WYMT</a>&nbsp;in 2021.

The dispatcher was able to recognize there was something off about the situation and communicate with the caller with questions that could be answered "yes" or "no."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The dispatcher, Tim Teneyck, told the officers to turn their sirens off and noted that all of the caller's communication matched with domestic violence situations. The caller, who asked to stay anonymous, later <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>told NBC News</a> that she was being physically abused by her boyfriend before she placed the call. Since the incident, domestic violence support groups have started teaching the strategy as a way for victims to alert the authorities without tipping off their abusers.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-the-black-dot-on-hand></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>The Black Dot on Hand</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Getty Images/InStyle</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The Black Dot signal went viral on Facebook in 2015. The idea behind the method is simple: Victims of domestic violence can draw a black dot on their palms as a signal to friends and family that they are being abused. The Facebook campaign, started by a domestic violence victim, reached millions of people. To this day, it's one of the most recognizable nonverbal signals of abuse.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">However, the Black Dot method also received criticism for drawing unwanted attention to victims — and potentially putting them in more danger. The campaign page has been taken down in response.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"As a way of seeking help, it's not going to be a solution for everybody. As a victim, you know what triggers your abuser," the signal's creator&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>told BBC</a>&nbsp;in 2015. "So if it's not safe to draw a black dot, don't do it ... you know yourself what is safe and what is not safe."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-stan></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>STAN</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_36-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Getty Images/InStyle</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Following the tragic death of Gabby Petito — the 22-year-old who was found dead after going missing in Wyoming in September 2021, as&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>reported by&nbsp;People</a>&nbsp;— folks on the internet speculated she was trying to send a message for help in a text to her mother. The text read: "Can you help Stan, I just keep getting his voicemails and missed calls."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">People online claim that "Stan" is actually an acronym for "Send The Authorities Now," though it hasn't been verified as an official code by any professional bodies. Mentions of STAN being a code word went viral after she was reported dead. However, as it's not quite as well-known as some of the other code words and signals, the use of STAN might not be as effective.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-to-respond-to-a-help-sign></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_43-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How to Respond to a Help Sign</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_44-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Calling 911 is not the best response for every instance involving a distress signal and can sometimes put the abused person in more danger. The Canadian Women's Foundation has a list of alternative action items that are especially helpful if the distressed person is someone you know.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_46-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For example, you can try calling the person and asking them questions that can be answered with "yes" or "no" — such as "Would you like me to get in touch with a shelter on your behalf?" If communicating by text, keep questions vague ("How are you doing?") in case their devices are being monitored. Lastly, don't be afraid to consult resources like the National Domestic Violence Hotline.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_48-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If you or someone you know is experiencing domestic violence, call the&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>National Domestic Violence Hotline</a>&nbsp;at 1-800-799-SAFE (7233).</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wZ6YrqypZLWmrcutn2aemam7pr%2FSaJuiq6SnsrS%2FjKygoKaRocBurcGuqp5lo560r7%2BMoKyinJU%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdistress-signals-abuse-signs-guide.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fdistress-signals-abuse-signs-guide.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fdistress-signals-abuse-signs-guide.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fdistress-signals-abuse-signs-guide.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdistress-signals-abuse-signs-guide.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdistress-signals-abuse-signs-guide.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./andrew-shue-removes-photos-of-wife-amy-robach-from-his-instagram-amid-t-j-holmes-rumors.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./andrew-shue-removes-photos-of-wife-amy-robach-from-his-instagram-amid-t-j-holmes-rumors.html>Andrew Shue Removes Photos of Wife Amy Robach From Instagram</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./wwe-nxt-heatwave.html>wwe nxt heatwave - Wrestlezone</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./wwe-nxt-heatwave.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
