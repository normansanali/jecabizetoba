Let’s get started.</p><h2>John Buultjens Wikipedia-bio</h2><p>John Buultjens is an actor, author, and popular BMX figure. He was born in Scotland to his mother, Margaret Craig, and his abusive father. When he was 3 years old, his father threw him into an electric fire.</p><p>The incident is the worst memory for the actor who has the scars to verify it. At 7 years of age, John ended up in foster care, where Mr. and Mrs. Buultjens adopted him. At first, he was quite uncomfortable with his Sri Lankan brown-skinned father, and it took him six months to accept the family.</p><p>In 1986, the family moved to Dundee, and his parents reside there even now.

There, he worked in different jobs, which included a role in the TV soap opera ‘Neighbours.’ John continued his passion for BMX riding and started collecting bikes. He stayed in the country for a large portion of his life and successfully became a BMX rider.</p><p>In his late thirties, John moved to America.
