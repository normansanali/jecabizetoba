When my brother and I got hungry, we asked her to buy us food. Since everything at places like these is extremely inflated, my cheap grandma refused to but us normal food. She proceeded to walk up to the stand where you can buy crackers to feed the goats, and bought my brother and I a handful or crackers for $2. Horrific experience."<p>- <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">GuruDroo</a></p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">2. Well, that's one way to get a free meal.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: istock</span></figure>"A friend of mine would join us for dinner to, let's say, Applebees. He'd order a side dish/or nothing at all, then wait till everyones done eating, and say, 'Hey, you going to finish that burger/fries/chicken?' to everyone who had leftovers. Then make him self a full plate/meal with everyone's leftovers and eat it."<h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">3.

The scrubs really get me.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: istock</span></figure>"I knew someone who once went to buy shampoo at a Walmart and didn't like that the bottle wasn't filled to the very top. (Don't try explaining to her that bottles need room to expand during transport.) So she unscrewed another bottle and poured it into the bottle she wanted to buy to top it off. Well, security cameras saw her doing this and she was busted by the security officers. She got argumentative and combative and ended up being arrested. All for half an ounce of shampoo. "Then she got kicked out of med school for stealing scrubs to wear because she was too cheap to buy real clothes."<p>- <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">austex_mike</a></p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">9.

She continued to attempt to do this after even after she got caught. If she did the inviting we discovered she would hustle people away from the table, about the same time another group would leave, and cut back and take a share of the tip they had left!"<p>- <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">StatOne</a></p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">11.

OK, with all the research she did, this borders on impressive.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: istock</span></figure>"I was working at Target when a woman came forward with an odd assortment of items. I rang them all up for her and it totaled to just below 300 bucks. She asked me to hold on for a second and pulled out a plastic bag. "It was one of those gallon-sized Ziplocks and it was chock-full of coupons and those 5-dollar gift cards you can get through certain deals at Target. Apparently she had called the store, or a store ahead of time, and had a list of what order to put each of the coupons through. "I scanned them one buy one. Now when you use a coupon if it won't work due to some reason like 'coupons limited to this amount' or 'only when buying such and such product,' it will stop you. In this case not a single one did, they all went through. Then, she used the gift cards. "She ended up paying 10 cents."<p>- [deleted]</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">14.

I was the inventory manager at the time, and dreaded those sales because we could never keep up with demand. I remember this one older lady very clearly though.&nbsp; I ONLY ever saw her come in during those sales. She would buy (No exaggeration) 100 cases of cans and take them home in multiple trips in her old tan Volvo. It was during one of these trips that I got saddled with helping her with the carry out to load her beast of burden. In the middle of stacking, she said, 'Me and the babies are going to eat well for a while!'&nbsp; I stopped mid-stack, turned to her, and said 'Excuse me?' because I thought there was no way I could have heard that right. But nope. She proceeded to explain how she got very little money from her pension, SSI was a joke, so she made things stretch because Friskies '...Is totally edible! And very yummy!'&nbsp; I had one of my stockers do the rest of her trips. I wasn't sure which disturbed me more: The fact that she ENJOYED the food, or the fact that in her older years she'd been reduced to eating cat food to survive."<p>- [deleted]</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">16.

Yea, I wouldn't keep this guy around my friend group much longer...</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: istock</span></figure>"I had a 'friend' in high school who was the cheapest guy I have ever met. Some of the things he would do: -Bum cigs off everyone he knew throughout the day, then go stand in the smoke pit at lunch and offer to sell those same cigs to people for $1 per cigarette.<br>&nbsp; -God forbid we ever use his car to drive anywhere. He would divide the mileage by the time and charge us for rides, anywhere. I remember he asked me for $2 for gas money the one time I ended up in his car to go a few blocks away.<br>&nbsp; -He would show up to parties or events with his own booze and never share; unless of course, he was offering, in which case he would charge you for shots.<br>&nbsp; -He would complain about anything to get a free meal. Once we were at Wendy's and he put a piece of his own hair in a burger to get it free.<br>&nbsp; -Nobody ever ate around him because he would always ask for at least half then try and guilt trip you if you refused. He never ever bought a pack of smokes and leached his way through life on that. He would try and open lockers and steal people's stuff.<br>&nbsp; I use the term "friend" very loosely because he wasn't a friend. His sister was hot as hell and a part of our group so he would hang around with us. No one talked to him and we made fun of him but he never left.

One day, a gathering of families ensued where each family was to bring some food. We brought two large bowls of salad and two more bowls of macaroni salad, while other people brought hot dogs, burgers, pizza, cake, etc. This one family brought a bowl of maybe fifteen small mushrooms they picked from their driveway before coming over.
