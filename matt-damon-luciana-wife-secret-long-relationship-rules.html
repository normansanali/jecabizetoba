Matt Damon was one of many stars to emerge from the decade, and he has been turning in great work for years.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Damon has done it all, including <a href=#>saving Christian Bale's career</a>, <a href=#>feuding with other stars</a>, and even making amazing cameos in the <a href=#>MCU</a>.</p><p>Damon's career has been one for the ages, but it has kept him away from his family for great lengths of time. Thankfully, Damon and his wife have found a way to make it work, in a rule that has changed the game for their marriage.</p><h2 id=matt-damon-is-a-major-star>Matt Damon Is A Major Star</h2><p>When looking at the biggest names in Hollywood, there aren't many out there that come close to rivaling what Matt Damon has accomplished during his time in Hollywood. The man can legitimately do it all, and he has earned acclaim for a variety of endeavors during his career.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For many, Damon is best known for his work as an actor. He has starred in popular movies like Good Will Hunting, Saving Private Ryan, Dogma, The Talented Mr. Ripley, The Departed, the Bourne franchise, and the Ocean's franchise. As great as this is, the man can also write, as well.</p><p>As a writer, Damon took home an Oscar for his work on Good Will Hunting. This was a key moment in his career, and since then, he has been one of the biggest names working in Hollywood.</p><p>Damon has made plenty of headlines for his work, but he has also made headlines for his personal life, as well.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Why Matt Damon And Abigail Breslin Got Along So Well Working On This Film</a></span></p><h2 id=matt-damon-married-his-wife-luciana-in-2005>Matt Damon Married His Wife Luciana In 2005</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2005, Damon made headlines when he and his wife, Luciana, tied the knot. The pair had been together for some time, and just like that, Damon, one of Hollywood's most eligible bachelors, was off the market.</p><p>Their first encounter happened randomly, but it set the stage for what has been a thriving marriage.</p><p>When speaking with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Vogue</a>, Luciana described the night they met.</p><p>"Matt’s story is that he saw me across the room and there was a light on me. And I’m like, ‘Yeah, it was a nightclub—there were lights everywhere!’ But he had started getting recognized and asked for pictures and autographs, and then it got kind of aggressive because people are drinking and stuff, and so he came and hid behind my bar … [wanting to] just hang out back there and have a drink. He says, ‘Oh, I saw you and I really wanted to talk to you.'”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>From there, Matt spent the rest of the night helping her behind the bar.</p><p>"So it turned into a really fun night and then 15 years later here we are," she said.</p><p>The couple has a total of four children, and they've been making things work since their first encounter. Turns out, they have a rule in place that has been a huge help.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Fans Are Not Buying Matt Damon's 'Nice Guy' Behavior, And Here's Why</a></span></p><h2 id=matt-and-luciana-had-a-rule-about-spending-time-apart>Matt And Luciana Had A Rule About Spending Time Apart</h2><p>So, how do Damon and his wife make things work? Well, having a rule about the time they spend apart has been the best thing for them.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to the actor</a>, "We have a two week rule. I'm not away for more than two weeks. I think you need to be with the person you love as much as possible. My wife is my soul mate. I don't like being apart from her."</p><p>This is a great way to keep things afloat. Long-distance is exceptionally difficult, and for the Damon clan, things obviously work best when they don't have to spend a ton of time away from one another.</p><p>The rule has been effective, but it has been broken once.</p><p>"We kind of had a family meeting about it and my kids let me do it ... I just thought it was such a beautiful story and such a great role," said Damon about breaking the rule for the film Stillwater.</p><p>"This was the first movie where [the two week rule has] been violated. So that was tough, and it helped with the performance. It was easy to access what I needed to access because I was really missing my kids," he continued.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Given that the pair have been married so long and have made things last in a business that sees marriages crumble regularly, the rule is working to a fantastic degree.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How This Iconic Actor Helped Matt Damon Land A Role In 'Saving Private Ryan'</a></span></p><p>Things work differently for different couples, but maybe, others out there in the business could take a page out of Damon's love story.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>The Truth About Matt Damon And Chris Hemsworth's Relationship</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGikmqykYrGiuc6nZKWtk56ur62MsKCfnV2osqS%2BxK1kpaeenHqzscuaq6Knnqi1qryMq6ylnaNk</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmatt-damon-luciana-wife-secret-long-relationship-rules.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fmatt-damon-luciana-wife-secret-long-relationship-rules.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fmatt-damon-luciana-wife-secret-long-relationship-rules.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fmatt-damon-luciana-wife-secret-long-relationship-rules.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmatt-damon-luciana-wife-secret-long-relationship-rules.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmatt-damon-luciana-wife-secret-long-relationship-rules.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./mike-perry-biography-wiki-net-worth-married-wife-height-weight.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./mike-perry-biography-wiki-net-worth-married-wife-height-weight.html>Mike Perry Biography, Wiki, Net Worth, Married, Wife, Height, Weight</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./mary-lee-harvey.html>Mary Lee Harvey Biography</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./mary-lee-harvey.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
