And as it turns out, there are a ton of Easter eggs hidden in Jeeps and this has been happening since<strong> 1997</strong> thanks to automotive designer Michael Santoro who wanted to enhance the Jeep Wrangler.</p><p>The person behind the first hidden secrets is Michael Santoro who worked on the<strong> 1997</strong> Jeep Wrangler TJ. Here’s a video that goes into detail about Jeep Easter eggs Image credits: NowCar</p><p>Joel Feder explains in a piece on Motor Authority when Jeep started putting various awesome Easter eggs into their car designs. The person behind the first hidden secrets is Michael Santoro who worked on the 1997 Jeep Wrangler TJ.</p><p>Updated: For the 2020 model year, Jeep has included numerous new and exciting Easter eggs in their models for owners to find. We’ve updated the article to include all the hidden animals and clever references that come standard with every new Jeep! Jeep, the company, was founded in 1943 but didn’t build its first civilian vehicle until 1945.</p><p>Jeeps first ever Easter egg was on the ’97 Wrangler. It was the iconic seven-bar grille hidden in the cowl. Since then Jeep started placing the Easter eggs more carefully. One of these well-hidden objects is the vintage Willys jeep driving on the windshield.</p><p>Since 1941 “Easter Egg” Found In The Headlamp Of The Jeep® Grand Cherokee. (Jeep). In the automotive world, “Easter eggs” are hidden decorative motifs that designers conceal in their vehicles, meant to be discovered throughout time by their owners.</p><h2>Why is the Jeep Wrangler alive?</h2><p>The Wrangler will stay alive because<strong> they are making it even more appealing by enabling customers the ability to customize it further.</strong></p><p>In<strong> 1996</strong> when the Wrangler TJ was unveiled, it wasn’t just round headlights that came back to the iconic off-roader. It was also when the first hidden feature was included—and no one noticed.</p><p>Santoro’s assignment? The 1997 Jeep Wrangler, known as the<strong> TJ.</strong></p><p>Santoro had the cowl, the hood, the plastic parts that get added to the body, and the grille panel to design; everything else was locked-in<strong> because there wasn’t enough budget to perform a clean-sheet redesign</strong> according to Santoro.</p><p>Sanatoro said Chrysler got smart by<strong> offering so many aftermarket parts ranging from different door systems to bolt-on parts:</strong> “It’s almost like Legos.”</p><p>From the get-go, Santoro noted that the new Jeep he was designing was different.<strong> It wasn’t a complete redesign</strong> or a blank slate like the Cirrus and Stratus he had previously worked on. The entire body and doors were slated to be carried over from the YJ.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>A bulldog is a great inspiration for an off-road vehicle because the widest point is very low, according to Santoro.<strong> The Jeep Wrangler has the same stance as a bulldog if you look at it from the front: it’s wide and solid, and it can’t be tipped over.</strong></p><h2>What Jeep has Easter eggs?</h2><p>Jeep<strong> Wrangler</strong> Easter eggs. The report reveals that the American automobile brand Jeep has been mastering the placement of Easter eggs on their cars for the past 23 years. Jeeps first ever Easter egg was on the ’97 Wrangler. It was the iconic seven-bar grille hidden in the cowl.</p><p>This Easter egg is<strong> a symbol or a shout out of sorts to the 1941 Will </strong>y<strong> Jeep</strong> used<strong> in World War II.</strong></p><p>An Easter Egg in the 2019 version says, ‘To new adventures.’. This is truly<strong> in keeping with the spirit of Jeep and how it makes a driver feel.</strong></p><p>Morse code in form of Easter egg. Many jeep owners might have noticed that there is JL inscribed on its steering wheel, underneath the L, which is generally shorter than that J, are some morse code inscriptions. The BuzzNicked report points out that the morse code is nothing but JL written in the code.</p><h2>What is the Loch Ness monster on a Jeep?</h2><p>Jeep<strong> Compasses</strong> often feature an image of the Loch Ness Monster on the rear window. This pays homage to the fact that Compasses can ford up to 19 inches of water. Some Jeeps have a scene showing a T-rex chasing a Willys Jeep that is chasing BigFoot.</p><p>Given that Jeep has 23 years of experience hiding these little gems, it can be difficult to find them. In 1997, a designer,<strong> Michael Santoro,</strong> who was working on the Jeep Wrangler wanted to come up with a way to leave his own unique mark on the vehicle—or as he said, “Make it more Jeep.”.</p><p>Some Jeep Gladiator owners can find the number “419” engraved into the rear. This is the area code for<strong> Toledo, Ohio </strong>, where it’s manufactured.</p><p><strong>Every Jeep vehicle since the 1990s has a little surprise,</strong> known<strong> as an “Easter egg.”.</strong> No, we’re not talking about the colorful eggs your kids hunt down on Easter, but an unexpected, hidden feature added to a product as a bonus.</p><p><h3 class=jp-relatedposts-headline>Related</h3></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivmaC2b6%2FEpZybqpmpxm%2ByzGiuoZmkYsamrdFmm6KcXZ%2BypryMrKuaqqRitaqwyKeeZp2RqMGmvoyenqCrXW2CeIKVaA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-year-did-jeep-start-hiding-easter-eggs-85766.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhat-year-did-jeep-start-hiding-easter-eggs-85766.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhat-year-did-jeep-start-hiding-easter-eggs-85766.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhat-year-did-jeep-start-hiding-easter-eggs-85766.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-year-did-jeep-start-hiding-easter-eggs-85766.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-year-did-jeep-start-hiding-easter-eggs-85766.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./angelina-jolie-changing-face-from-1991-to-2016-w441771.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./angelina-jolie-changing-face-from-1991-to-2016-w441771.html>Angelina Jolie Changing Face, From 1991 to 2016</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./vince-neils-net-worth-2024.html>Vince Neils Net Worth 2024</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./vince-neils-net-worth-2024.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
