Reportedly, Mia was at a music festival near the Gaza Strip when Hamas terrorists abducted her. It’s believed that Mia is one of more than 200 people held against their will by this extremist group.</p><p>Recently, Hamas released a video showing Mia, where she asked for help and reassured everyone that she was being taken care of and given proper food. The 59-second video also showed a doctor caring for her badly injured arm.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Mia-Schem.webp><p>Mia’s family is very worried about her safety. Her mother, Karen Schem, shared her concerns in an interview, talking about Mia’s kind and pure-hearted nature. Mrs. Karen urges the Israeli government to do everything possible to bring her daughter back home.</p><p><img decoding=async title="Israeli French Woman Mia Schem" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Israeli-French-Woman-Mia-Schem.webp alt="Israeli French Woman Mia Schem" width=400 height=327 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2><strong>Mia Skim Released From Hamas</strong></h2><p>Mia Skeem, the 21-year-old French-Israeli woman who captured global attention after being abducted from the Supernova music festival in Israel and featured in a chilling Hamas hostage video, has been successfully released.</p><p>The joyous reunion took place as Mia Skeem, who was training to become a tattoo artist, was freed along with seven other hostages in two separate releases on Thursday.</p><p>The Supernova festival had taken an unexpected dark turn for Skeem, who was prominently showcased in a 78-second video on Hamas’s Telegram channel, revealing her injured arm being attended to by an unidentified medical professional. In the video plea, she urgently appealed to be reunited with her family at the earliest.</p><p>The emotional scene unfolded as Skeem’s mother, Keren, who had tirelessly campaigned for her daughter’s release, was caught on camera by Israeli channel N12, overcome with tears of joy as she received the news and rushed to embrace her other children.</p><p>Skeem’s father, David, expressed his overwhelming emotions, stating, “First, her mother is going to jump on her, and then I’ll come and hold her in my arms. I won’t say a word… I don’t want to ask questions. I don’t know what she’s been through.”</p><p>In a heartfelt statement, the family expressed gratitude to everyone involved in securing Skeem’s release and urged for “calm and quiet” in the upcoming days as Mia undergoes medical treatment in the hospital before returning home.</p><p>French President Emmanuel Macron also joined in the celebration, sharing his joy on social media, stating, “I share this great joy with her family and all French people.”</p><p>Described as exceptionally creative on a campaign website advocating for her release, Mia Skeem was lauded by her mother, who remarked, “Everything she touches turns to gold.” Skeem, the second of four children, had attended the music festival with friends, including Elya Toledano, another French-Israeli who remains missing and presumed held hostage.</p><p>Read Also: <a href=# rel=noopener>Who is Noa Argamani?

While she was being taken there, her mom, Karen, tried calling her multiple times, but Mia couldn’t answer.</p><p>Karen didn’t know what happened until the IDF (Israel Defense Forces) informed the family that Mia had been abducted and taken to Gaza.</p><p><img decoding=async title="Mia Schem underwent surgery due to a severe injury" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Mia-Schem-underwent-surgery-due-to-a-severe-injury.webp alt="Mia Schem underwent surgery due to a severe injury" width=400 height=218 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h2><strong>Video of Mia Schem Released By Hamas</strong></h2><p>A video was recently shared by the Hamas group, showing Mia Schem in Gaza. The video displayed a 21-year-old woman, Mia, who had been hurt and was being taken care of for a gunshot wound in her arm. Mia had a long three-hour surgery and was being looked after by medical professionals.</p><p>In her message in the video, Mia asked the people in charge to help her come back home safely and quickly so she could see her parents and siblings.</p><p>Unfortunately, earlier on Monday, Israeli authorities shared the news that 199 people had been taken and were being kept captive by Hamas in Gaza.</p><p>This increased the previously known number by 50. What’s even more worrying is that it’s believed some Americans might be among those who were taken, with at least 13 citizens from the United States currently missing.</p><p>The IDF, which is the Israeli Defense Forces, has assured everyone that they are using all their intelligence and operations to bring back all the hostages, including Mia, as soon as possible.</p><p>Read Also: <a href=# rel=noopener>Who is Shani Louk?
