Though Carlos N. likely was able to stand on his own accord, police officers had to hold up the Chucky doll by its bright orange hair in order to snap the photo.</p><p>Images of the doll being handcuffed and posed for a mugshot quickly went viral on social media. With the virality came condemnation for the Monclova police officers for not taking their job seriously.</p><p>“Some journalists were jokingly telling [them] to pose with the doll, to put handcuffs on it,” Alcocer said. He added: “[They] must take [their] job and the regulations seriously [and] not play those games.”</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-454671 alt="Police Officer Posing With Chucky Doll" width=850 height=669 data-sizes="(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/police-officer-posing-with-doll.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-454671 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>César Cespada/X</span><span class=caption-body>Local police were criticized for handcuffing the doll and posing it for mugshots, as some said they should take their job more seriously.</span></p><p>Indeed, the officer who put handcuffs on the Chucky doll was later reprimanded.</p><p>The iconically terrifying doll first made its appearance in the 1988 film Child’s Play. In the film, a serial killer uses a voodoo ritual to implant his soul into a doll as he dies from a gunshot wound. The doll then finds its way into an innocent family’s home, where it begins its reign of terror.</p><p>Since then, the Chucky doll has appeared in seven more films and even made a foray into television. And, apparently, it was also used by Carlos N. as an accomplice to try and rob terrified pedestrians in Monclova.</p><p>But that chapter of Chucky’s story has one final twist. According to <a href=# rel=noopener>Mexico News Daily</a>, Carlos N. was released shortly after his arrest. But it’s unknown if the Chucky doll remained in police custody. Reuters reports that “the Chucky doll’s whereabouts are still unknown.”</p><p>“The [suspect] came with his doll…well, the doll [was] taken away along with his belongings once he reache[d] the cells and he [was] locked up,” Alcocer told Fuerza Informativa Azteca.</p><p>Did the doll remain in police custody? Is it now collecting dust in some obscure processing room deep in the Monclova station? For now, the answer seems unclear. But those wandering around the city’s public square should perhaps keep their eyes peeled for a doll with a shock of orange hair.</p><p>After reading about the Chucky doll that was arrested in Mexico for threatening people with a knife, discover the terrifying true story of <a href=#>Annabelle the doll</a>.
