As of the year 2022, his age is <strong>38 years old.</strong> Latifa bint Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum is her given name. Her ethnicity is Emirati. She is from the Arabic community.

Similarly, she has lived a lavish lifestyle since she was born as a royal family member. Her <strong>net worth</strong> must be in the $2.5 million range.</p><h2><span id=Controversy>Controversy</span></h2><p>While becoming a member of the royal family, Latifa bint Mohammed Al Maktoum dislikes the climate. On February 24, 2018, she and her friend Tiina attempted to flee Dubai in a car. They were crossing the border into Oman before joining former French intelligence officer Hervé Jaubert and his crew on the yacht Nostromo.</p><p>Just two days later, she emailed human rights lawyer David Haigh and informed him of her departure from Dubai via her social media account. She had to explain her motives. She released a 39-minute video in which she accused her father of maltreating her and her sister Shamsa, as well as other serious allegations, including murder. They arrived in Goa, India, in March 2018, but were stopped by Indian authorities. Only a few days later, reports of the loss of the yacht called “Nostromo” emerged. In December 2018, BBC Two aired a documentary titled “Escape from Dubai: The Mystery of the Lost Princess” based on her disappearance. Latifa, on the other hand, made it home safely.</p><p>Similarly, she has been kept in a private villa for at least a year, leaving her to feel stuck and abducted in her own house. A video of her recently appeared on the internet in February 2021. That video alleging that her father was being held captive in the villa turned into a prison in Dubai.</p><p>She said she is being held in solitary confinement even though no charges have been filed against her. In reaction to the video, the UN intervened and requested “proof of life” from the UAE. And the family responded that Princess is “being cared for at home”.</p><h2><span id=Personal_Life>Personal Life</span></h2><p>Latifa bint Mohammed Al Maktoum has not yet shared any intimate details about her life. She has, however, often asked for advice on social media about her own life and the care she has received from other family members. Nonetheless, she has attempted to flee her home.</p><h2><span id=Body_Measurements>Body Measurements</span></h2><p>Latifa bint Mohammed Al Maktoum is a stunning woman in her 30s with a well-maintained physique. She has a light skin tone, black hair, and blue eyes.</p><h2><span id=Latifa_bint_Mohammed_Al_Maktoum_8211_Social_Media>Latifa bint Mohammed Al Maktoum – Social Media</span></h2><p>Moreover, Latifa is only active on <strong>Instagram</strong>.
