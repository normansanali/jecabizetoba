Both in and out of the studio, Keyshia has shown her personality and individual style. While things can get shaken up between albums, Keyshia does keep things consistent, delivering memorable hits reliably with other artists just as talented as she is. With over a decade of experience in the industry, Keyshia remains one of the top producers of R&B, consistently producing hits. While she may not be as popular as in her early 2000's days, Keyshia is still down to ride and create with more content on the way.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Keyshia has worked with many talented individuals in her lifetime, which is why it can be good to note and review a few accomplishments. Some collaborations were small, just a verse or two. Others were bigger and better, spanning over entire projects to create something special. In recent history, Keyshia has continued to make waves, one big one with her most recent album 11:11 Reset. She worked with many collaborations throughout that release in 2017, including with French Montana, <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Young Thug</a>, and Remy Ma. Below we'll go over other collaborations she's had in the past and how they've gone.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-just-like-you-and-a-different-me><strong>Just Like You And A Different Me</strong></h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Just Like You And A Different Me was released early in 2006. Working with Diddy to create the song Last Night, Keyshia Cole worked with Diddy to promote the song for their own album, Press Play. These efforts were not only for these two though, as it later ended up appearing on her LP. During the documentation of the album, it was featured on the reality TV show Keyshia Cole: The Way That It Is. Keyshia also worked with <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener" class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Missy Elliot </a>for the number-one hit single Let It Go. The second single after this featured both Keyshia and Amina Harris. This single performed well on the US Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs. During this time, Keyshia was also featured on Jahiem's single, titled I've Changed. Keyshia Cole also appeared as a guest during <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Trina</a>, C-Side, and <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Missy Elliott</a> songs in 2008.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-the-way-it-is><strong>The Way It Is</strong></h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">In 2004, March, Keyshia collaborated with American Rapper Eve to create Never. The song Never was her debut single, released as a lead single for the movie Barbershop 2: Back in Business. On that same album, Cole released her first feature with Kanye West, titled I Changed My Mind. She also collaborated with DJ Green Lantern to make Team Invasion Presents Keyshia Cole. This remix featured remixes of longtime loved hip-hop instrumentals, as well as parts of songs from other albums.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-diddy><strong>Diddy</strong></h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Drama stirred between multiple collaborators during many of these collaborations, especially between Diddy, Keyshia, and Lil Mo.&nbsp;Keyshia Cole, while working with Diddy and Lil Mo, controversy arose.<span> She</span>&nbsp;accused Lil Mo of betrayal, to which Lil Mo disregarded the statement, believing Keyshia Cole to be intoxicated at the time. Cole denied this after the statement. During that time, Keyshia Cole was accused of cheating with collaborator Diddy during their collaboration over Last Night. Keyshia Cole denied the accusations.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Despite the drama, Keyshia teamed up with Diddy for this R&B track, which was released in 2006 and features production by <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Mario</a> Winans. The song was a commercial success, peaking at number two on the US Billboard Hot 100 and becoming one of Keyshia's biggest hits to date.</p><span></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Keyshia Cole collaborated with Monica to release the single "Trust." In 2005, Trust appeared on "The Way It Is." The initial song did so well that Monica featured it on her main album as well.&nbsp; &nbsp;The song features production by Soulshock & Karlin and showcases the two artists' vocal abilities, as they sing about the importance of trust in relationships. Considering the drama at the time that directly has everything to do with trust, to say that there is some comedic timing there is an understatement.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-remy-ma-and-french-montana><strong>Remy Ma and French Montana</strong></h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Remy Ma</a> first appeared on Keyshia Cole's radar in 2005, when she collaborated with them during The Way It Is's initial hype. Many years later, Keyshia Cole is still collaborating with Remy Ma, during a lead single titled You. Remy Ma assists with this single by singing a verse. Under production by Harmony Samuels, the song quickly became a fan favorite among Keyshia Cole fans and Remy Ma adorers alike. During an interview with Rap-Up magazine, Keyshia Cole announced the title for that album the collaboration would be featured on, dubbing it 11:11 Reset.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-bobby-valentino><strong>Bobby Valentino</strong></h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Keyshia and Bobby Valentino teamed up for an emotional ballad titled "I Should Have Cheated. The emotional song was eleased in 2006 and became a hit on urban radio stations. The song features production by Ron Fair and Soulshock & Karlin and deals with the aftermath of infidelity in a relationship.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdmaYJ4gphmop6xo522onnCqKOeZZOkua2twaipmqyZpLu0</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f645769-keyshia-cole-collaborations.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2f645769-keyshia-cole-collaborations.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2f645769-keyshia-cole-collaborations.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2f645769-keyshia-cole-collaborations.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f645769-keyshia-cole-collaborations.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2f645769-keyshia-cole-collaborations.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./king-of-the-4th-quarter.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./king-of-the-4th-quarter.html>King of the 4th Quarter</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./kendall-jenner-makes-relationship-with-bad-bunny-instagram-official-as-kris-jenner-pushes-her-to-get-married.html>Kendall Jenner Makes Relationship With Bad Bunny Instagram Official As Kris Jenner Pushes Her To Get</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./kendall-jenner-makes-relationship-with-bad-bunny-instagram-official-as-kris-jenner-pushes-her-to-get-married.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
