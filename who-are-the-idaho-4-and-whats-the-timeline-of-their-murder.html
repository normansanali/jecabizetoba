But although the media spotlight has been turned to him – as it often happens in homicide cases – he’s not the protagonist of this story. If anything, and if he’s in fact the killer <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">as the evidence seems to suggest</a>, he’s the villain who unjustifiably robbed these very young adults of the vital right to continue creating their own beautiful narratives, and their friends and family of seeing them unravel as they should have.</p><p data-characters=197 data-current-count=197 data-injectable=false>So, let’s bring the focus back to those who deserve it, for the fact that they lived and should’ve kept living if someone, an unfeeling monster, had not stolen that sacred right away from them.</p><h2 id=h-who-are-the-victims data-injectable=false><strong>Who are the victims?</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Design-sem-nome-2023-12-01T163015.032.png><p data-characters=590 data-current-count=590 data-injectable=true>Xana Kernodle, 20, from Avondale, Arizona, is <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">described by her older sister</a>, Jazzmin, as “one of the happiest, funniest people [she’s] ever met.” This is especially admirable taking into consideration the rocky start she had in regards to her family <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">in her first years</a>. Due to their parents’ toxic patterns which included drug abuse, Xana and Jazzmin would end up being rehomed to live with her uncle and aunt. Despite the difficulties – perhaps in part because of them – Xana grew into someone who strived to manifest the positive energy she wished to be surrounded by.</p><p data-characters=518 data-current-count=518 data-injectable=true>Ethan Chapin, 20, from Conway, Washington, is Xana’s boyfriend. He is one of 3 triplets – a girl, Maizie, and two boys, Ethan and Hunter – and he “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">loved</a> his siblings, boats, and working on a tulip farm.” Jazzmin Kernodle described him as “the sweetest kid ever.” Ethan’s family won’t be attending the trial as, according to what his mother <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">told NBC’s TODAY</a>, they have trust in the prosecutors to do their work as the now family of 4 needs to focus on healing and being there for each other instead.</p><p data-characters=533 data-current-count=533 data-injectable=true>Maddie Mogen and Kaylee Goncalves, both 21 and from Idaho, were inseparable best friends, even in their last hours as they slept side by side on the same bed on the house’s third floor. The two met a decade ago <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">in 2013 at Charter Academy</a> in the city of Coeur d’Alene in Kootenai County. They went with each other on family vacations and insisted on being enrolled at the same high school, Lake City High School. Mogen’s boyfriend, Jake, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> he hoped his girlfriend is remembered for the love and kindness she spread to others.</p><p data-characters=454 data-current-count=454 data-injectable=true>Unlike Ethan’s family – who have every right to their own grieving process – Kaylee’s family is ready to be at the trial and see justice be served with their own eyes. Her father, Steve Goncalves, spoke with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">ABC News saying</a>: “I can’t wait to see the evidence. … And then I’m gonna bring it, and he’s gonna realize that this … is the family that’s gonna make sure he doesn’t get away with it.”</p><h2 data-injectable=false><strong>The tragedy taking place on</strong> <strong>November 13, 2022</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Design-sem-nome-2023-12-01T163436.306.png><p data-characters=367 data-current-count=667 data-injectable=true>The victims were all home by 2 am, with Maddie and Kaylee having gone to eat some mac and cheese from a food truck, and Ethan and Xana having attended a nearby party at a fraternity house. At around 4 am, Xana got DoorDash and records show that at 4:12 she was active on TikTok. Around this time, the victims were all in their beds more than ready to call it a night.</p><p data-characters=195 data-current-count=195 data-injectable=false>The first to be attacked were Maddie and Kaylee, in this order. Due to the way their sleeping arrangement was set up, Kaylee would wake up to find herself, in her parents’ words, “trapped.”</p><p data-characters=290 data-current-count=485 data-injectable=true>One of the two surviving roomates, alerted by noise for a second time – this time around by what she thought to be Xana crying – opened the door and she would get to see the killer, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">clad in all black</a>, walk right past her and out of the home, effectively leaving four dead and two alive.</p><p data-characters=240 data-current-count=240 data-injectable=false>No murder weapon was ever found but the Marine Corps knife sheath, cleaned off of DNA except for a speck belonging to Kohberger, was discovered seemingly placed beneath the body of one of the two best friends on purpose, likely a misdirect.</p><p data-characters=305 data-current-count=545 data-injectable=true>At 4:20 a white Hyundai Elantra was captured on footage speeding away from the area after having passed by the street three times prior to the time of the crime. It took over 7 hours for the police to be called. The four students, with their whole lives ahead of them, were pronounced dead at around noon.</p><p data-characters=362 data-current-count=362 data-injectable=false>More than a month later, and when some people feared the investigation was stalling, a suspect was finally revealed and taken into custody. In August 2023,<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> Bryan Kohberger waived his right to a speedy trial </a>so it got postponed indefinitely, which is yet another layer of hurt that the suspect, if he’s indeed guilty, is putting these bereaved families through.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeemsS0e9ahpmaZopp6tbTEZqCdmZikenV5wKebZq%2BYlsG0edOhnGasmaKyrbXNnmSonl2ptaa10WakrqqUmr9w</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-are-the-idaho-4-and-whats-the-timeline-of-their-murder.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwho-are-the-idaho-4-and-whats-the-timeline-of-their-murder.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwho-are-the-idaho-4-and-whats-the-timeline-of-their-murder.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwho-are-the-idaho-4-and-whats-the-timeline-of-their-murder.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-are-the-idaho-4-and-whats-the-timeline-of-their-murder.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-are-the-idaho-4-and-whats-the-timeline-of-their-murder.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./ben-bradlee.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./ben-bradlee.html>Ben Bradlee</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./human-radiation-experiments-united-states-government.html>When And Why It Happened</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./human-radiation-experiments-united-states-government.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
