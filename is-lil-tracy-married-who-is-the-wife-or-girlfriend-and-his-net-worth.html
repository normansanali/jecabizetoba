<time>28 Jul 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>Lil Tracy is singer, rapper, and songwriter of American origin, best recognized for his singles Checkmate and This Year, as well as for all the collaborations he had with the deceased rapper Lil Peep. Notable among their partnerships are Awful Things and White Wine, with the former peaking at number 79 on the Billboard Hot 100. Tracy is one of the major artists in the most recent SoundCloud rap scene, and from what is obvious; he is painstakingly paving his way to the very top of his career in music.</p><p>Possibly due to his pedigree, the young Tracy opted to carve out a career for himself in music at a very tender age, which is understandable as he is the child of a union between the lead singer of Sisters with Voices music group, and a band member with Shabazz Palaces and Digable Planets. Lil Tracy was just 18 when he relocated to California, though he has been publishing most of his music online right from when he turned 15. Ultimately, he grew his fans via SoundCloud, and today, he is seen as an upcoming rapper with a promise of greater things to come. The singer cum rapper has persevered with his music, entertaining fans and the general public with his songwriting skills and vocal powers.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-is-lil-tracy></span><strong>Who is Lil Tracy?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The rapper, singer, and songwriter was born in Virginia Beach, Virginia on the 3rd of October 1995. He was given the name Jazz Ishmael Butler at birth. His parents are notable personalities in the music industry, while Lil Tracy’s mum Cheryl Clemons (AKA Coko) is best known as the lead vocalist with Sisters With Voices and has several Billboard Hot 100 singles under her belt, his dad Ishmael Butler is a band member with both Shabazz Palaces and Digable Planets. The young rapper’s father is not just an ordinary band member; he is actually a 1993 Grammy award winner in the category of Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group. There is no record of any siblings for the rapper which points to the fact that he is possibly the only child of his parents.</p><p>Though they were both successful in their careers as entertainers, being great contributors to both hip-hop and R&B in the 90s, Lil Tracy’s parents did not record equal success in their matrimonial life. In fact, their union hit the rocks while Tracy was still in his formative years, which resulted in his spending a greater part of his childhood torn between both parents, bouncing from Seattle where he stays with his dad to Virginia for some time out with his mother. His academic records say that he was a student of Garfield High School, though we cannot possibly say whether Tracy graduated or not. According to the promising rapper cum singer, he was bipolar and a loner during his days in high school.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-lil-tracy-married-who-is-his-wife></span><strong>Is Lil Tracy Married, Who is His Wife?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Lil Tracy is quite a mysterious guy as he has kept every detail pertaining to his personal life under wraps. Till date, the famed rapper is yet to open up about the woman in his life, which has made fans and the general public to believe that he is not hooked up with any lady currently. From what is perceivable, he prefers to concentrate more on his work than keeping a romantic relationship.</p><p>However, a couple of girls have been spotted with him especially on his Instagram uploads, but he is yet to mention anyone as his significant other. Speculations are that Lil Tracy might be currently involved with a girl, and is keeping it secret and confidential or maybe he is waiting to meet the right woman.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-his-net-worth></span><strong>What is his Net Worth?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Though he is seen as an emerging rapper, Lil Tracy has recorded an admirable level of success in his music career with several singles as well as mixtapes to his name. However, the media has not succeeded in getting hold of the figures for his net worth as he is particularly a secretive guy. But a source went ahead to peg it at $100,000 which is subject to verification. As long as he keeps on improving, his figures are sure to rise.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKGjYrmquIytqZqbqWK6or7RopydZaedvG610maroZ1drLansYyoqWafmae5p77InqWdZZGjsW60yKxkp52kYsSwvtOhZg%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fis-lil-tracy-married-who-is-the-wife-or-girlfriend-and-his-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fis-lil-tracy-married-who-is-the-wife-or-girlfriend-and-his-net-worth.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fis-lil-tracy-married-who-is-the-wife-or-girlfriend-and-his-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fis-lil-tracy-married-who-is-the-wife-or-girlfriend-and-his-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fis-lil-tracy-married-who-is-the-wife-or-girlfriend-and-his-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fis-lil-tracy-married-who-is-the-wife-or-girlfriend-and-his-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./is-richwcampbell-dating-mia-malkova-details-about-his-relationship.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./is-richwcampbell-dating-mia-malkova-details-about-his-relationship.html>Is Richwcampbell Dating Mia Malkova?
