She has an estimated <strong>net worth</strong> of more than $700,000, which she has amassed through her successful journalism career in just the last decade.</p><h2><span id=Sonia_Azad-_Birth_Age_Ethnicity_Siblings_Education>Sonia Azad- Birth, Age, Ethnicity, Siblings, Education</span></h2><p>Sonia Azad was born on September 17, 1982, in Houston, Texas, USA. She is of Asian-American heritage and is of part-Persian (Farsi) descent.</p><p>As of 2019, she is 37 years old. Sonia’s childhood and how she became interested in the field of journalism are unknown; however, it is known that after graduating from high school, she attended the University of Texas, Austin, where she earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Journalism. She also attended Northwestern University’s Medill School of Journalism and its famed law school, where she earned a Master’s Degree in Journalism and a Master of Legal Studies in 2010.</p><h2><span id=Sonia_Azad-_Relationship_Married_Life_Boyfriend_Girlfriend>Sonia Azad- Relationship, Married Life, Boyfriend, Girlfriend</span></h2><p>Sonia was supposed to be dating her coworker on News 8 Daybreak, Ron Corning after fans saw their on-screen chemistry.

The corporation eventually issued a statement confirming that they were not in a relationship. Sonia tweeted a selfie of herself with a teddy bear in September of 2017 and identified him as her boyfriend.</p><p>Sonia is still single in 2019 and spends the majority of her time working, describing herself as a workaholic. When she isn’t traveling the world covering news, she’s either teaching yoga, running a marathon, or doing charity work, which leaves no time for a significant other. Sonia has stated that running a marathon in Antarctica appears to be a more likely option than finding a husband. Despite the fact that she does not have a significant other, Sonia has expressed a desire to have a child or children, with or without a spouse. After her friends had gone through the process, she detailed her 24-day adventure with egg-freezing on her blog in 2016, guaranteeing that she had viable eggs that would enable her to become a mother when the time came.</p><h2><span id=Sonia_Azad-_Professional_Career>Sonia Azad- Professional Career</span></h2><p>Sonia obtained her first professional experience while studying at the University’s radio station.

She serves on numerous charitable groups and councils, including the Asian Leadership Council for the Houston Symphony, the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, the Houston Advisory Council for the Tahirih Justice Center, and the Halo House Foundation Board of Directors. She is frequently spotted delivering Meals on Wheels to older folks in South Dallas.</p><h3><span id=Achievements_and_awards>Achievements and awards</span></h3><p>Azad’s hard work and dedication were recognized in 2011 when she received an Emmy Award for her half-hour special report, ‘Passage to India.’ The Texas Associated Press Broadcasters named her one of the state’s best reporters the following year.</p><h2><span id=Body_Measurements_Height_Weight_Hair_color>Body Measurements: Height, Weight, Hair color</span></h2><p>Sonia is Asian, with black hair and dark brown eyes.
