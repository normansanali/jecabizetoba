He is a graduate of the University of Oregon and the Stanford Graduate School of Business, and his journey to success in the business world started during his time at the University of Oregon, where he was a member of the track and field club under coach Bill Bowerman. He and Bowerman would later go on to co-found Nike.</p><p>Throughout his life, Knight has been known for his generosity and philanthropic efforts. He has donated hundreds of millions of dollars to his alma maters, the University of Oregon and Stanford Graduate School of Business, as well as to the Oregon Health & Science University. In total, he has donated over $2 billion to these three institutions, making a significant impact on their growth and development.</p><p>He had a diverse professional background before starting his company. He initially worked as a Certified Public Accountant (CPA) for two different firms, Coopers & Lybrand and Price Waterhouse. Later, he became an accounting professor at Portland State University.</p><p>After completing his education at the University of Oregon, Knight enlisted in the Army and served for a year on active duty and seven years in the Army Reserve. He then pursued his Master’s degree in Business Administration at Stanford Graduate School of Business, where he wrote a paper that foreshadowed his future venture into the athletic shoe industry.</p><p>During a trip around the world after graduation, Knight made a stop in Kobe, Japan and discovered the Tiger brand running shoes manufactured by the Onitsuka Co. Impressed by the quality and affordability of the shoes, Knight secured the distribution rights for the western United States. He sent two pairs of shoes to his future business partner, Bill Bowerman, who was coaching at the University of Oregon. Bowerman not only ordered the shoes but also offered to become Knight’s business partner and contribute to product design. The two men formed Blue Ribbon Sports by handshake on January 25, 1964, which later became Nike.</p><p>In the beginning, Knight made sales of the shoes from the trunk of his car at track meets across the Pacific Northwest. By 1969, the company had grown enough for Knight to leave his job as an accountant and work full-time for Blue Ribbon Sports. The company’s first employee, Jeff Johnson, suggested the name “Nike,” after the Greek goddess of victory, and Blue Ribbon Sports was officially renamed Nike in 1971.</p><p>The iconic “swoosh” logo of Nike was created by graphic design student Carolyn Davidson in 1971 for just $35. Knight eventually came to appreciate the logo and in September 1983, Davidson was given a significant amount of Nike stock for her contribution to the company’s brand. Over the years, Knight developed personal relationships with some of the world’s most renowned athletes, including Michael Jordan and Tiger Woods.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Phil Knight Net Worth: How Much Is Phil Knight Worth?</h2><p>Phil Knight’s net worth was estimated to be around $47.7 billion. In addition to his business success, Phil Knight is also known for his philanthropy. He and his wife, Penny, have made significant donations to a variety of causes, including education, healthcare, and the arts. In 2015, they announced a $500 million gift to Oregon Health & Science University, which was the largest single donation in the state’s history at the time.</p><p>It’s important to note that net worth can fluctuate depending on various factors, such as changes in the stock market or personal investments.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTGqKqsoaBjsLC5jqmfoqRdoLuqs8etZKedpGLEsL7ToWY%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fphil-knight-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fphil-knight-net-worth.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fphil-knight-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fphil-knight-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fphil-knight-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fphil-knight-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./takahashi-kazuki-net-worth-income-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./takahashi-kazuki-net-worth-income-html.html>Takahashi Kazuki Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./osquinn-who-is-p4rkr-on-spotify.html>Osquinn: Who Is p4rkr On Spotify?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./osquinn-who-is-p4rkr-on-spotify.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
