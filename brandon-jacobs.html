In his NFL, he has helped his franchise with many victories.</p><h2><span id=College_Career>College Career</span></h2><p>Talking about his educational career, he studied at Assumption High School where he played basketball and football.</p><p>During his senior years, he earned awards such as USA&nbsp;Today&nbsp;All-America,&nbsp;Orlando Sentinel All-Southern, Prep Star All-Region, and Louisiana Class 4A Most Valuable Offensive Player.</p><p>During his final year, he ran for more than 3,000 yards and scored 38 touchdowns.</p><h4><span></span></h4><p>His college career began at Coffeyville Community College in Coffeyville, Kansas, where running backs coach Dickie Rolls and head coach Jeff Leiker were in charge.</p><p>A member of the Kansas Jayhawk Community College Conference is Coffeyville.</p><p>He ran for 1,349 yards and 17 touchdowns during his first season at Coffeyville in 2001, earning an honorable mention for the Kansas Jayhawk Conference All-Conference team.</p><p>In addition, he was also recognized as CCC’s team MVP. He gathered 1,896 yards and 20 touchdowns on 267 carries for the Red Ravens in his sophomore season, averaging 7.1 yards per carrying.</p><p>Jacobs was selected to the KJCCC All-Conference First Team and was awarded a JUCO All-American as a result of his accomplishments.</p><h4><span>Auburn University and Southern Illinois</span></h4><p>Furthermore, he attended Auburn University alongside first-round draft choices Carnell Williams, Ronnie Brown, and Jason Campbell.</p><p>He was the backup running back to Carnell and Ronnie. Brandon rushed for 446 yards and two touchdowns for the Tigers in 2003.</p><p>He transferred to then-Division 1-AA Southern Illinois after the 2003 college football season. Further, he had another excellent year at Southern Illinois.</p><p>Jacobs led the team with 150 carries for 992 yards (6.6 average) and 19 touchdowns.</p><p>In addition, he was selected All-American first-team by The NFL Draft Report, All-Gateway Conference first-team, and Gateway Conference Newcomer of the Year.</p><p>He topped the league in scoring and was rated ninth in the country, averaging 9.5 points per game. He had eight catches for 83 yards (10.4 average), six kickoff returns for 140 yards (23.3 average), and five 100-yard running performances, including playoffs.</p><h2><span id=Professional_Career>Professional Career</span></h2><p>Talking about his professional career, he was graded the 11th best running back available in the&nbsp;2005 NFL Draft&nbsp;by&nbsp;Sports Illustrated.</p><p>He was expected to be taken early in the fourth round, and that is exactly what happened (110th overall).</p><h4><span>New York Giants</span></h4><p>He admits watching the footage of renowned power running back Eddie George before the 2006 season to improve his running technique.</p><p>Eddie was a big, strong running back like him. Brandon ran the ball 96 times for 423 yards and nine touchdowns during the 2006 season, averaging 4.4 yards per carry.</p><p>To that, he added 11 catches for 149 yards. In the 2007 season, he replaced Tiki Barber as the Giants’ starting running back when Tiki announced his retirement.</p><p>Jacobs suffered a knee injury in the opening game vs the Dallas Cowboys, but four weeks later, he was able to play against the New York Jets and carry for 100 yards and a score.</p><p>Despite missing two more games due to a hamstring injury later in the season, he finished the regular season with 1,009 yards and four touchdowns on 201 touches.</p><p>A further 23 catches for 174 yards and two scores were added by him. In the NFC Divisional Playoffs matchup with the Dallas Cowboys, he&nbsp;scored the game-winning touchdown. As the Giants won the Super Bowl XLII, Jacobs started each game throughout the postseason.</p><h4><span>Underwent surgery and returned to play preseason</span></h4><p>He had wrist surgery in the offseason of 2008. His knee continued to trouble him during the regular season, but he came back to play the whole preseason.</p><p>He had 219 carries for 1089 yards and 15 touchdowns at the end of the regular season in 2008—the same number of carries as in 2007, but with much more scores.</p><p>He and Derrick Ward joined the other four teammates who had rushed for 1,000 yards in a single season in 2008. The Giants gave him the franchise tag on February 13, 2009.</p><p>A week later, he agreed to a four-year, $25 million contract with the Giants, and that year, he carried the most of the load.</p><p>Due to a knee injury, he was put on injured reserve on December 31, 2009. He received a $10,000 fine after throwing his helmet into the Lucas Oil Stadium stands on September 19, 2010.</p><p>In addition, he was announced as the Giants’ top running back for their game against the Jacksonville Jaguars on November 24, 2010.</p><p>He and the Giants took the field in Super Bowl XLVI at the end of the 2011 season. The Giants defeated the New England Patriots 21-17 due to his nine carries for 37 yards.</p><h4><span>San Francisco</span></h4><p>On March 28, 2012, he&nbsp;signed a contract with the San Francisco 49ers. After suffering a knee injury in training camp, he missed the first two months of the season and had little playing time after his comeback.</p><p>Brandon Jacobs played in two games and carried the ball five times for a total of seven yards, essentially serving as the third or fourth backup tailback.</p><p>Following many posts by him&nbsp;on social media platforms criticizing his lack of playing time, including one in which he said he was “on this team rotting away,” the 49ers banned him for the last three games of the same season. On December 31, 2012, the 49ers released him.</p><img aria-describedby=caption-attachment-233312 decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographymask.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Brandon-Jacobs-poto-during-a-NFL-match-against-New-York-Jets.jpg alt="Brandon Jacobs " width=650 height=432 data-sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-233312 class=wp-caption-text>Caption: Brandon Jacobs photo during an NFL match against New York Jets (Source: Bleacher Report)</p><h4><span>The reality television shows, Shark Tank, and Impact Wrestling</span></h4><p>He made an appearance on episode #406 of ABC’s Shark Tank on October 19, 2012, together with Pro NRG creator Tania Patruno, to present the startup company’s protein supplement/energy drink and maybe secure some funding for the endeavor.</p><p>Additionally, during the February 16, 2012, broadcast of Impact Wrestling, he made an appearance.
