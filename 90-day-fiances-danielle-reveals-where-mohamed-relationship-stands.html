<time>20 Aug 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>All good! <a href=#>90 Day Fiance</a>’s <strong>Danielle Mullins</strong> revealed that there are “no romantic feelings” between her and her ex-husband, <strong>Mohamed Jbali</strong>, four years after their divorce.</p><p>“I think that we’re better off as friends,” the reality star exclusively told Us Weekly while promoting the current season of 90 Day: The Single Life. “We’re very supportive of each other and <a href=#>we’re just better off as friends</a>. I mean, he’s supportive of my schooling and I’m supportive of his job. I think what helps me to communicate with Mohammed is my dad used to be a truck driver and I talked to him about his trucking job.”</p><p>Fans first met the former couple on season 2 of <a href=#>90 Day Fiancé</a>, which aired 2014. At the time, Mohamed, who met Danielle online, moved from Tunisia to Ohio to try and make their relationship work.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/90-Day-Fiances-Danielle-Says-There-Are-No-Romantic-Feelings-With-Mohamed-001.jpg><p>The pair’s ups and downs, which played out on the series and its spinoff <a href=#>90 Day Fiancé: Happily Ever After?</a>, included a cheating scandal that involved Mohamed chatting online with other women. After initially seeking an annulment in October 2016, Danielle was granted a divorce in March 2017.</p><p>Following their split, the duo stopped speaking for three years. During a recent episode of <a href=#>90 Day: The Single Life</a>, however, fans saw Danielle and Mohamed catch up for the first time. Their conversation was both emotional and healing.</p><p>“That first conversation, I felt like I got some of the closure that I needed,” she told Us. “But then when we had the second conversation via zoom [and] I definitely got more of the closure that I needed, and I felt much better after the second conversation.”</p><p>Danielle noted that having their marriage be so public <a href=#>hurt their relationship</a>, which is why they’ve “kept people out of our friendship, and we keep everything between me and him.”</p><p>While fans didn’t get to see the pair makeup on camera, Danielle told Us that she does feel like she’s “gotten the apology” she deserved from her ex-husband … off camera. The TLC personality explained that although they had a rocky split, her friendship with Mohamed has brought her peace.</p><p>“I never thought that it would happen, but he’s [grown] over the years. He’s in his 30s now, you know, they say guys mature later,” she told Us. “So, I think he’s matured a lot over the years after being out on his own and having things happen to him and he’s realized that I was a good person and that I did a lot for him and took him that long to realize it.”</p><p>Danielle revealed that she feels like he “genuinely” wants to be close with her now that he doesn’t “need anything from me.”</p><p>The reality star added that <a href=#>her kids are “OK” with her friendship</a> with Mohamed, saying that her former spouse is “really fond” of her youngest child and is “always asking about her” when they speak.</p><p>When it comes to moving forward romantically, Danielle said she would be “OK” with Mohamed finding someone else.</p><p>“I mean he deserves to be happy too, but I think right now he’s just too busy with truck driving,” she explained, noting he knows about her relationship with new love interest, Robert, which has been playing out on <a href=#>90 Day: The Single Life</a>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>90 Day: The Single Life and The Single Life Pillow Talk are now streaming on Discovery+.</p><p>With reporting by Christina Garibaldi</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGZyaF2Zrrp5xaKYp5uVqHqlrc2inKWklWK%2FpsLEmqOsZaedsrOxjKamoZmdmrFuvsSlmK2hn6PAqbXPZqqtmZ6ZwHA%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f90-day-fiances-danielle-reveals-where-mohamed-relationship-stands.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2f90-day-fiances-danielle-reveals-where-mohamed-relationship-stands.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2f90-day-fiances-danielle-reveals-where-mohamed-relationship-stands.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2f90-day-fiances-danielle-reveals-where-mohamed-relationship-stands.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f90-day-fiances-danielle-reveals-where-mohamed-relationship-stands.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2f90-day-fiances-danielle-reveals-where-mohamed-relationship-stands.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./all-my-adventures-with-superman-villains.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./all-my-adventures-with-superman-villains.html>All My Adventures with Superman villains</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./jamie-lee-curtis-on-oscar-nom-i-sold-yogurt-that-makes-you-s-t.html>'I sold yogurt that makes you s--t'</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./jamie-lee-curtis-on-oscar-nom-i-sold-yogurt-that-makes-you-s-t.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
