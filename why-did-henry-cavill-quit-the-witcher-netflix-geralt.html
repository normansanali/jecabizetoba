But Henry was saying that when you read the books you spend a lot of time in Geralt’s head. So how can we put that on the page?” Hissrich explained whilst promoting the sophomore season.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=henry-cavil-concerned-tv-version-of-geralt-was-simple><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Henry Cavil Concerned TV Version Of Geralt Was Simple</span></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Henry Cavill noted that the Netflix version of the character was far less complicated than the book version</a>. In the book, he often philosophizes about ethics and the line between good and evil.

And so, it was about me trying to find Geralt’s place within that. All of my asks and requests were along the lines of just being faithful to the source material.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=did-henry-cavill-hint-at-his-departure-from-the-witcher><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Did Henry Cavill Hint At His Departure From The Witcher?</span></h2><p>Fans believe Henry Cavill may have commented about the recasting situation a few days ago in his interview with Josh Horowitz.

If you believe what you’re doing then you’ll be able to keep on doing it. It’s also important to know that if you realize you’re doing the wrong thing, that’s when you stop doing the wrong thing.
