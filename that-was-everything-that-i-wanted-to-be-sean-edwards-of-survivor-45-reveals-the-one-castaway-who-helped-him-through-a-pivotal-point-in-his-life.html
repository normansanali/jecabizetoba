I tried everything, everything to live a straight, faithful Mormon lifestyle, and because of those many, many years that I lost, Survivor for me was an opportunity to reclaim that lost time,” he prefaced, before explaining that he wanted to leave the game altogether.</p><p data-characters=248 data-current-count=248 data-injectable=false>After admitting that his true “adventure of a lifetime” is back home with his husband, Sean asked for his tribe to vote him out that fateful night, garnering a stunned reaction from longtime host and executive producer – <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jeff Probst</a>.</p><p data-characters=357 data-current-count=605 data-injectable=true>“I know how bad that all four of you really want this.

Watching him play authentic to who he is as an openly gay man [and] confident, that was everything that I wanted to be,” Sean gushed.</p><p data-characters=94 data-current-count=94 data-injectable=false>Not only did he look up to Todd as an individual, but he also admired his phenomenal gameplay.</p><p data-characters=341 data-current-count=435 data-injectable=true>“He was able to go out there and make connections with people, and then when he didn’t need them, because they didn’t serve his gameplay anymore, he tossed him out… I feel like he played a cutthroat game. I feel like he was genuine to who he is, and so I just really vibed with that,” he concluded passionately.</p><p data-characters=140 data-current-count=140 data-injectable=false>To see how the rest of Survivor 45 plays out, even without Sean Edwards in it, catch brand-new episodes every Wednesday at 8pm ET/PT on CBS.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y1tMCtZLCZo2Kyt7HRsquhoZ6cerW0wK1komWnlru1scNmq6hlkpp6tLHAp2SenKeWv6W%2FjKidZqulp8Oqws6rZG1tXaeyt7HApapmrJiaerC6xGaamquklsSixYywn6hlmJq5sbHDZp%2BipV2ptbO71KCfZpldpba3u9Oao2aon567tXnIp2ShoaNiuaqyxGg%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthat-was-everything-that-i-wanted-to-be-sean-edwards-of-survivor-45-reveals-the-one-castaway-who-helped-him-through-a-pivotal-point-in-his-life.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fthat-was-everything-that-i-wanted-to-be-sean-edwards-of-survivor-45-reveals-the-one-castaway-who-helped-him-through-a-pivotal-point-in-his-life.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fthat-was-everything-that-i-wanted-to-be-sean-edwards-of-survivor-45-reveals-the-one-castaway-who-helped-him-through-a-pivotal-point-in-his-life.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fthat-was-everything-that-i-wanted-to-be-sean-edwards-of-survivor-45-reveals-the-one-castaway-who-helped-him-through-a-pivotal-point-in-his-life.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthat-was-everything-that-i-wanted-to-be-sean-edwards-of-survivor-45-reveals-the-one-castaway-who-helped-him-through-a-pivotal-point-in-his-life.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthat-was-everything-that-i-wanted-to-be-sean-edwards-of-survivor-45-reveals-the-one-castaway-who-helped-him-through-a-pivotal-point-in-his-life.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./star-wars-costumes.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./star-wars-costumes.html>The Best Star Wars Costumes for Kids</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./teala-dunn.html>Teala Dunn Wiki, Bio, Parents, Height, Weight, Net Worth, Facts</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./teala-dunn.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
